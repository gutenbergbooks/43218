<h1  id='chI'>CHAPTER I — “He and I Must Never Meet”</h1>

<p>You will recall that one day in a recent
August, Jack Crandall, a member of
the Stag Patrol of Boy Scouts, who
with the Blazing Arrow and Eagle Patrols
was spending the summer vacation on the
shore of Gosling Lake, in Southern Maine,
met with a serious accident. In climbing
a tall pine to inspect a bird’s nest, he fell to
the ground and broke his leg. His companions,
Gerald Hume and Arthur Mitchell,
belonging to the same Patrol, made a litter
upon which he was carried to the clubhouse.
Dr. Spellman, staying with his
wife and little daughter Ruth, christened
“Sunbeam” by Mike Murphy, in answer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
to a signal, paddled across the lake in his
canoe, set the fractured limb and did all
that was necessary.</p>

<p>Jack was an athlete, in rugged health
and with no bad habits. He, therefore,
recovered rapidly. After spending a few
days on his couch, he was carried to the
front porch, where in the cool shade and
reposing upon an invalid chair, especially
fashioned for the occasion, he feasted his
eyes upon the delightful scenery and enjoyed
the pleasures of his friends although
he could not take part. He insisted that
they should pay no special attention to
him, though there was not a boy who would
not have gladly kept him company all the
time. A reunion of the troop took place
in the evening, when he was carried inside,
listened to the reports and took part in the
conversation which you may be sure was
of a lively nature.</p>

<p>Thus the days passed until the arrival of
the silver mounted maple wood crutches,
a gift from the other Scouts, and Jack
swung carefully out on the porch and walked
the length of it several times before sinking
down in the waiting chair. This, of course,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
did not take place until the month was well
by and the time for going home near. I
thought it best to close my previous story
with this glimpse of things, but it now becomes
my duty to turn back and relate
some incidents that occurred during the
first days of the patient’s convalescence,
since they have to do with what follows.</p>

<p>Dr. Spellman and his wife returned to
the bungalow on the day succeeding Jack’s
mishap.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall and several of the lads
expressed their surprise that no call had
been made by Uncle Elk, the Hermit of
the Woods, who showed so much fondness
for the Boy Scouts that they expected to
see him every day, provided the weather
was favorable.</p>

<p>“I am sure he would have been here last
night or this morning, had he known of
Jack’s misfortune,” said Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>“If ye have no ’bjection I’ll drop in on
him and let him know,” replied Mike
Murphy, whose heart was as sympathetic
as that of a young child.</p>

<p>“Please do so.”</p>

<p>Mike glanced around for his chums,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes, but
they were not in sight. It did not matter
and he decided to make the trip alone,
using one of the canoes to take him to the
end of the lake, where he would follow the
path that led to the cabin through the
woods.</p>

<p>“On me way back,” remarked Mike to
the Scout Master, who walked with him
to the water’s edge, “I’ll drop in to larn
how Sunbeam is getting on.”</p>

<p>The Scout Master smiled.</p>

<p>“That will take you considerably out of
your way.”</p>

<p>“It’s not worth the mintion, as Ball
O’Flaherty said whin he fell off the church
steeple and broke his neck. Then ye know
it’s a long time since I saw Sunbeam.”</p>

<p>“Yes,—less than a day.”</p>

<p>So the Irish youth seated himself in the
stern of the graceful craft, and swung the
paddle with creditable skill. No task could
have been easier, and he grinned with satisfaction,
as keeping close to shore, he
watched the trees with their exuberant
foliage glide silently backward.</p>

<p>“A canoe is a blissed boon to byes that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
can’t walk; we might set Jack in one of
’em, and he could paddle wherever he
wished. I’m going to suggist to me friends
that whin they go back home, each of ’em
has a canoe mounted on wheels, so he can
roam round the country, the same as if
he’s skimming over the water as I’m doing
this minute. I’d try it mesilf whin I get
back, but dad would objict and there’s so
much water there I don’t naad anything
of the kind.”</p>

<p>Far over to the left, he saw the other
canoe handled by several of the Scouts,
while somewhat nearer and a little way back
from the water, a thin, feathery finger of
smoke filtering through the tree tops showed
where Dr. Spellman’s house stood.</p>

<p>“Sunbeam has been gone so long that
I’m worrit less something may have happened
to her; I won’t tarry at Uncle Elk’s,
but make haste to relave me mind as regards
the Quaan.”</p>

<p>Uncle Elk’s canoe was drawn up the bank
and turned over. Landing near it, Mike
followed the winding path to the door
from which the latch string hung, pulled
it and stepped across the threshold.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span></p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Uncle Elk,” was his
greeting as he closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>The hermit was sitting in his rocking
chair, reading “The Truth of Religion,”
by Rudolf Eucken, Professor of Philosophy
in the University of Jena and winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1908.
The old man laid aside the heavy volume,
still open, face downward.</p>

<p>“Michael, I’m glad to see you.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward, shook hands and
motioned the youth to the chair opposite.
Mike obeyed with the remark:</p>

<p>“We have been expecting a call from
ye, Uncle Elk.”</p>

<p>“You don’t wish me to bore you with
too much of my presence,” said the hermit,
with a twinkle of his bright eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s something that can’t be done, if
ye tried it till ye were an old man,” replied
Mike warmly. And then told of the mishap
that had befallen Jack Crandall. Uncle
Elk listened sympathetically.</p>

<p>“That’s bad, but it might have been
much worse.”</p>

<p>“Which Jack himself has obsarved,—for
instance, ’spose it had been <span class='it'>mesilf</span>.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span></p>

<p>“That surely would have been worse for
<span class='it'>you</span>, but better for him. You say that
Dr. Spellman set his injured leg?”</p>

<p>“That he did, and I couldn’t have done
it better mesilf. He called this morning
and said the spalpeen was doing splendid.”</p>

<p>“When will the doctor call again?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sartin,—but likely tomorrer.”</p>

<p>“Forenoon or afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say.”</p>

<p>Uncle Elk withdrew his gaze from the
face of the lad and looked into the fireplace,
where only a few dying embers showed.
He was silent for a few moments and then
addressed his caller.</p>

<p>“Michael,” he said in low tones, “I shall
call upon Jack at the earliest opportunity,
but my call must be timed so there will
be no possibility of meeting Dr. Spellman.”</p>

<p>Mike was amazed by the words and at
a loss what to say. Therefore he said what
after all was perhaps the best thing.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that the doctor doesn’t try any
expirimints on ye.”</p>

<p>The old man actually laughed, but only
for an instant. With a shake of his head
he said:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t that, Michael, but he and I
must never meet.”</p>

<p>The youth was astounded, but his sense
of propriety forbade any questioning. If
Uncle Elk did not choose to make known
the cause of his strange enmity, Mike had
no right to object.</p>

<p>A strained silence followed for a minute
or two, when the hermit again looked
meditatively into the smouldering embers.</p>

<p>“It can be easily arranged: let Dr. Spellman
make his calls at such times as suit
his convenience and I will adjust mine
accordingly.”</p>

<p>“That should be aisy. I hev it!”</p>

<p>“Let me hear your plan.”</p>

<p>“’Spose the doctor makes it a rule to
call ivery other day and ye can fit yer
visits in betwaan, though we should like
it to be oftener.”</p>

<p>“That would hardly answer, for he might
be needed every day. A better plan will
be that he should never call at the bungalow
during the evening. If he agrees to that,
everything will be right.”</p>

<p>“That’ll doot! He wouldn’t come anyway
unless we signalled him, and if ye
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
happen to be at the clubhouse, ye’ll have
plinty of time to run.”</p>

<p>“How am I to know that he consents to
it?”</p>

<p>“If he objicts, I’ll come back and tell
ye; if he agraas, I won’t show up here agin
till after ye have visited us.”</p>

<p>“That settles the matter. I suppose,
Michael, you are wondering why I make
such a strange request?”</p>

<p>“I am, but I’m not asking any quistions,
as ye’ll obsarve.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will never learn from
me.”</p>

<p>Mike was slightly nettled.</p>

<p>“Why thin did ye think it worth while
to raise me hopes, whin I hadn’t made any
inquiries?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Michael; I shouldn’t
have done it. Let neither of us refer to
it again.”</p>

<p>“Do ye wish me to till Docther Spellman
what ye said?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Then consider that I’ve told him.”</p>

<p>“It would be hard for him to understand
my request unless he knew my feelings.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
You may as well stay to supper and over
night with me.”</p>

<p>“I thank ye, Uncle Elk, but I much fear
that if I don’t return to the byes they’ll
think I’ve tumbled out of a tree the same
as Jack, and have broke me neck. I’ll
bid ye good afternoon and make me way
to Docther Spelhnan. Onless ye hear from
me to the contrary, ye’ll understand that
he’ll not visit the bungalow on any avening
onless he is sent fur, so the way will be open
to yersilf.”</p>

<p>The hermit rose from his chair and stood
in the door as Mike walked down the path
to the side of the lake. He looked round
just before passing out of sight and waved
his hand to the old man, who nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty qu’ar,” mused the lad, as
he shoved off in his canoe; “the docther
has niver said a word as far as I’ve heerd
about any throuble between ’em, and I
couldn’t guess what it is to save me life.”</p>

<p>The bright, sunshiny afternoon was well
advanced when Mike paddled a little way
from shore and turned in the direction of
the thin wisp of smoke which revealed the
location of the physician’s summer home.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
Almost beyond sight could be made out
the second canoe, which some of the Scouts
had used in making an excursion over the
sheet of water. The craft was close in
shore and seemed to be motionless, as if
the boys were fishing. The distance was
too far for him to tell the number of occupants,
but he judged they were three or
four.</p>

<p>“And I belave Alvin and Chester are
among ’em,” he added, after a scrutiny of
the boat; “I mind me now that they said
something about going off to-day on a
cruise. Hello!”</p>

<p>The exclamation was caused by an unexpected
discovery. Between him and the
home of the physician he saw a second
spiral of vapor climbing up among the
treetops. Like that of the former, it was
so far back from the water that nothing
could be seen of the party that had kindled
it.</p>

<p>Mike held his paddle motionless while
he looked and thought.</p>

<p>“They must be strangers to the rist of
us. If this thing kaaps up, bime by we
sha’n’t have elbow room and will have to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
camp farther inland. I wonder now if they
could be some other Boy Patrols that have
strayed in here. They may have heerd of
us and desire to make me acquaintance,
as do most people.”</p>

<p>Mike had his natural share of curiosity,
and decided to learn who the strangers
were. He had enough time at command
to permit a diversion of this nature, and he
headed his craft toward the bank at a point
opposite the dim wavering column of vapor
which showed that a fire kindled beneath
was the cause.</p>

<h1  id='chII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>CHAPTER II — A Slight Miscalculation</h1>

<p>The distance was so slight that a
score of strokes drove the canoe to
shore. Nothing in the nature of a
path was to be seen, and there was so much
undergrowth that when Mike glided under
the vegetation, only the rear of the boat
was visible to any one on the lake. He
drew the craft up the bank far enough to
prevent its floating away during his absence,
and began picking his way through the
bushes. A few rods and the wood grew
more open, though not being much accustomed
to that sort of traveling, he made
considerable noise in his progress. He was
thus engaged with his head bent and his
arms thrust out in front feeling his way,
when a low horizontal limb slid under his
chin and as it almost lifted him off his feet
brought him to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>“Worrah! I wonder if me hid is left on
me shoulders!” he exclaimed, vigorously
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
rubbing his neck; “yis,—the most of me
is here, as Tarn Murry said whin he came
down after being blowed up in a powder
mill.”</p>

<p>A few rods farther and he came upon a
sight which caused him to halt as abruptly
as before, with a strong inclination to turn
about and go back to his canoe.</p>

<p>In a small open space a fire of pine
cones, twigs and branches was burning
beside the trunk of a fallen tree. Resting
on the top of the blaze was a tomato can,
filled with bubbling coffee, whose aroma
reached the nostrils of Mike at the moment
he caught sight of the fire. On the log sat
a ragged, frowsy tramp, with a crooked
stick in his hand tending the blaze, while
on the ground half lying down and half
sitting up, was a second vagrant sucking
a corncob pipe.</p>

<p>You remember the two nuisances who
called upon Dr. Spellman and because of
their insolence were sharply rebuffed by
him, though his wife, in the kindness of her
heart, gave them food. These were the
same hoboes, who it will be noted had not
as yet wandered far from the physician’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
home. You remember, too, their characteristic
names,—Buzby Biggs and Saxy
Hutt. Lazy, shiftless, dirty, rugged of
frame, thieves and unmitigated pests, they
were straggling through this part of Maine,
in mortal dread of two afflictions,—work
and a bath. They were ready to suffer
harsh treatment and privation rather than
submit to either.</p>

<p>Mike’s sensitiveness revolted at sight
of them, but before he could turn away,
both of the men, who must have heard his
approach, raised their heads and looked
toward him. Hutt, who was smoking the
pipe, slowly rose to his feet, stretched his
arms over his head, and beckoned with his
grimy forefinger.</p>

<p>“Welcome, my lord!” he called in his
husky voice; “wilt thou not come into our
baronial castle and partake of a flagon of
wine with us?”</p>

<p>The grotesqueness of the invitation appealed
to Mike and he walked forward,
recalling that he had not his buckthorn
cane with him. Had he gone for a tramp
through the woods he would have held it
in his hand, but it was in his way when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
using the canoe. He never carried firearms,
for to do so is to disobey one of the strictest
rules of the Boy Scouts, besides which, as
you know, an Irishman believes in the use
only of nature’s weapons, with the addition
perhaps now and then of a stout shillaleh.
Not that Mike Murphy expected any
trouble with these men, but the thought
which came to him was natural under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>He approached in his confident fashion,
with a grin on his face, halted a pace or
two from the fire, and with the couple
examining him, made the Boy Scout salute.</p>

<p>“’Tis so kind of ye that I will halt a
brief while and enj’y the hospitality of the
Knights of the Ragged Shirt and Dirty
Face.”</p>

<p>This was a pretty crisp salutation, but
it need not be said that Mike felt no more
regard for the couple than do all respectable
persons. He remained standing and
did not go nearer.</p>

<p>“Aren’t yer afraid of being arrested fur
yer beauty, young man?” asked Biggs with
a grimace.</p>

<p>“Not while yersilves are in the counthry.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are you anyway?”</p>

<p>“Mike Murphy of Southport, State of
Maine. I would exchange cards wid ye,
but I’m afeard ye couldn’t return the compliment.”</p>

<p>“I left my pasteboards at home on the
piany. We gather from your dress that
you’re one of them Boy Patrols.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re right, excipt jest now I’m on this
side of the lake.”</p>

<p>“Gee whizz! but you’re keen. How long
do you chaps intend to stay there?”</p>

<p>“Probably until we lave. We’re not
among the folks who hev to be kicked out
by their betters.”</p>

<p>“Meaning us?”</p>

<p>“As ye plaise; I want to be agreeable
to ye.”</p>

<p>Mike had not shown tact. He ought to
have reflected that it was imprudent to
rouse the resentment of two full grown men
of so lawless a character as these tramps
undoubtedly were. Combative as Mike
was by nature, he would have hardly been
the equal of one of them in a “shindy”
which could be easily started and which
it seemed he had set out to provoke.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span></p>

<p>“I observe,” said Biggs, “that you have
a brass chain dangling from yer coat pocket
in front; does the same signify that there’s
a watch anchored at t’other end?”</p>

<p>Mike answered the question by flipping
out his time piece and displaying it.</p>

<p>“The best Waterbury chronometer made,—price
a dollar and a half.”</p>

<p>“I should like to borrer the same for my
pal and me.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking ye would like to borrer a
good many things ye can’t; I carry a little
loose change in me pocket. Mebbe you’d
like to borrer the same?”</p>

<p>“Yer guessed it the fust time; while
yer turning over that turnip and chain yer
may as well h’ist out the few pennies in
yer garments.”</p>

<p>The tramp took a step toward the lad,
his companion grinningly watching proceedings.</p>

<p>The words and manner of Biggs left no
doubt that he meant to rob Mike of his
watch and money,—though neither was of
much value. Was the Irish youth angry?
I cannot do justice to his feelings, so let
us try to imagine his state of mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span></p>

<p>Prudence demanded that he should try
to conciliate the scamps, or, failing in that,
to dash off at the top of his speed, but two
reasons checked this course. You know
he was not formed for running, and either
one of the tramps could have overtaken
him by half trying. The other reason was
that Mike never ran from any foe. He
would die fighting before showing the white
feather. Convinced that nothing could
avert a fierce struggle, he instantly prepared
for it. He would have felt better had his
shillaleh been in his grasp, but it has already
been shown that his only weapons were
those which nature had furnished and no
youth of his years could have known better
how to use them.</p>

<p>I should be distressed if I had to describe
Mike’s fight with two full grown men, for
it was impossible that he should not get
much the worst of it. While it may
be a relief to picture one in his situation
as baffling, if not defeating two burly
despoilers, yet to do so would be contrary
to truth.</p>

<p>The youth recoiled a single step, closed
his fists and assumed an attitude of defense.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
Saxy Hutt, still stood grinningly listening
and watching. As he viewed the situation
it was preposterous to think his pal would
need his help. None the less, he would be
quick to give it should the call be made.</p>

<p>“Come on as soon as ye plaise, and I’d
as lief take both as one; don’t kaap me
waiting.”</p>

<p>“Hear him talk,” said Biggs, still advancing,
though more slowly than before; “he
makes believe he ain’t scared half to death.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll be thankful in less nor a minute
if ye’re allowed to escape wid yer life.”</p>

<p>This sounded like the wildest kind of
boasting, but it was justified. Since Mike
Murphy faced the two tramps, he saw what
was behind them, which they did not.
In a direct line with Biggs, slightly to the
left of Saxy, and no more than a dozen
paces to the rear, stood Dr. Spellman with
leveled revolver and face red with anger.</p>

<p>“Move a little to one side, Mike, so I
shall run no risk of hitting you,” called the
physician; “just now you’re right in line
with that ruffian.”</p>

<p>Buzby Biggs leaped fully a foot in air,
and with a gasp flashed his head about and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
stared at the point whence the dreadful
voice had come. Then his spiky hair
seemed to rise on end and lift his dilapidated
hat to a height of several inches.</p>

<p>“Shall I wing him, Mike?” asked the
doctor, with the weapon still at a level.</p>

<p>“Folly yer own plisure in that regard;
I don’t begrudge ye the enj’yment, as Mrs.
O’Flaherty remarked whin she refoosed to
fire at the bear that was chasing her husband.”</p>

<p>At that instant, Biggs emitted a howl,
and with what was left of his fragmentary
hat fluttering to the ground, dashed in a
headlong panic through the wood and
undergrowth toward the lake.</p>

<p>The sharp crack of the Smith and Wesson
rang out, and the fugitive made another
bound in air, as if he felt the sting of the
bullet, and dived out of sight.</p>

<p>“I missed him on purpose,” remarked
the doctor; “he isn’t worth a cartridge, but
I’m undecided about you.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he shifted his aim to Saxy
Hutt, who was a-tremble with fear.</p>

<p>“I—I—I’ve got an engagement,” he
stuttered, beginning to shamble in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
direction taken by his companion; “I’ll
bid you good day.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” sharply commanded his
master; “wait till I decide what’s best to
do with you.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, boss, I haven’t done anything.”</p>

<p>And too weak to stand in his excessive
terror, Saxy sagged back and sat down
heavily on the log. Mike could not help
pitying him.</p>

<p>“It was t’other spalpeen that meant to
rob me, docther.”</p>

<p>“One is as bad as the other; this one
would have helped had it been necessary.”</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor,” protested the aggrieved
Saxy, “how can yer think such a crool
thing of a gentleman like me? I was just
going to stop Buzby when yer spoke up.”</p>

<p>The physician lowered his weapon with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Off with you! I hope never to see the
face of yourself or Buzby again. You may
drink your coffee if you wish before you
leave.”</p>

<p>But the tramp had lost his thirst as well
as his appetite for the time. He came
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
unsteadily to his feet, and began moving
gingerly over the trail of his companion.</p>

<p>“I say, doctor,” he said, pausing a few
steps away, “if you feel like firing off that
little thing in your hand, please p’int t’other
way.”</p>

<p>“I shall take your request into consideration,
but don’t advise you to bank on
my granting it.”</p>

<p>Saxy increased his pace until it equalled
that of him who had gone before. Dr.
Spellman extended his hand to Mike.</p>

<p>“I hope that is the last of them. I
supposed they left the neighborhood, but
they will do so now.”</p>

<p>“Why do ye think that, docther?”</p>

<p>“Heretofore we had nothing positive to
bring against them. Now I can bear witness
that they tried to rob you. They know
it and have no wish to go to jail while the
weather is so pleasant outside. Let’s sit
down on this log for a wee bit, before going
to my house. Tell me how you came to
be in this place.”</p>

<p>“I was on me way from Uncle Elk’s
cabin whin the smoke of this camp caused
me to turn aside, wid the result that I’d
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
been mixed up in the biggest shindy of me
life if ye hadn’t took it in yer head to spoil
the picnic.”</p>

<p>“It was mighty lucky for you that I
did so, Mike. Did Uncle Elk send any
message to me?”</p>

<p>“He did that,” gravely replied Mike,
who thereupon told his friend of the assertion
of the hermit that he and the physician
must not meet.</p>

<p>“I had begun to suspect some such feeling
on his part, though not to the degree
he shows. I have called there twice, the
last time with my wife, who insists that
the old man was in his cabin at the time and
purposely kept out of our sight. He can
depend upon it that I shall not put myself
in his way, though I am wholly at a loss
to understand his enmity. But we may
as well go to the house, Mike.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the doctor rose to his feet,
and the two began threading their way
through the wood to the point where Mike
had left his canoe.</p>

<h1  id='chIII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>CHAPTER III — A Strange Occurrence</h1>

<p>It was not far to the edge of the lake,
and, as you will remember, there was
abundant undergrowth, but the fleeing
tramps had left a trail of broken and
twisted branches which it would have been
easy to follow, even with greater distance
and more uncertainty of direction. Mike
kept a few paces in the lead, and soon caught
the shimmer of water, but when he glanced
around saw nothing of his craft. He stood
perplexed when Dr. Spellman stepped beside
him.</p>

<p>“Where’s the canoe?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“That’s what meself would like to know.”</p>

<p>“Is this the spot where you stepped
ashore?”</p>

<p>Mike moved farther until his shoes
touched the water. He recognized the
projecting limb of a beech which had attracted
his notice when he came ashore.</p>

<p>“There’s no mistake about the same.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
Now, docther, that boat can’t hev a habit
of sneakin’ off whin ye’re not watching—what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>His companion touched his arm and
pointed over the water.</p>

<p>“There’s the answer to your question.”</p>

<p>“It beats me, as the drum said to the
drum stick.”</p>

<p>Some two hundred yards out on Gosling
Lake was the canoe heading toward the
western end of the sheet of water. In it
were seated Biggs and Hutt, the two rascally
tramps, their appearance suggesting
that they were owners of the graceful craft
in which they were making a pleasure
excursion. Their backs were toward the
two on shore, but Hutt who sat near the
stern turned his head. Observing the indignant
couple, he waved his hand in salutation
and grinned so broadly that the
gleam of his yellow teeth showed.</p>

<p>Neither Mike nor the doctor spoke for a
moment or two. Then the youth solemnly
extended his hand.</p>

<p>“Docther, would ye mind shaking?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, but what is the idea,
Mike?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span></p>

<p>“’Cause I can’t think of anything ilse
to do, as the p’liceman said whin he prosaaded
to break his club over the head of
ivery one in sight.”</p>

<p>“Were there ever two such pests? The
next time I get a chance I won’t kill them,
but I’ll give each something he’ll remember.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your boat?”</p>

<p>“At the foot of the path leading to the
house; the distance is so short that I did
not use it, but strolled to this point.”</p>

<p>“Let’s jump into the same and make
fur these spalpeens.”</p>

<p>The physician was so angry that he did
not hesitate. They hurried through the
wood to the spot where the other craft lay
as it had been left by its owner. It has been
shown that from this spot the house was
not visible and therefore the wife and
daughter knew nothing of what was afoot,
which perhaps was best. The doctor, being
the most skilful with the paddle, took up
the implement, and headed after the other
craft, which was making good progress
toward the farther end of the lake.</p>

<p>Each of our friends had asked himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
the question as to what Biggs and Hutt
meant by their act and what they were
likely to do. It could not be seen that the
vagrants had anything to gain, for they
must soon abandon the canoe and continue
their flight on foot. They knew the medical
man carried a deadly weapon, and did not
seem backward in using it, because of which
they certainly could not desire another
meeting with him.</p>

<p>Moreover, a third canoe was involved.
It seemed to have disappeared for the time,
but must be somewhere near the western
end of the lake, which being the case, the
tramps were likely to find themselves between
two fires, though it was not to be
supposed that they had any cause to fear
the unarmed Boy Scouts in the invisible
boat.</p>

<p>The flight and pursuit had lasted only a
few minutes when an unpleasant truth
impressed itself upon Mike and the doctor:—Buzby
Biggs, who swung the other paddle,
did it so deftly that his boat steadily drew
away from the pursuer despite the utmost
efforts of Dr. Spellman. In a straightaway
race the tramps were sure to win, but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
course had bounds, and in the end they
must be pocketed, a fact so apparent that
they themselves saw it from the first. They
had the choice of keeping directly on until
they reached the western margin so far
in advance of their pursuers that they need
give them no thought, or they could take
the shorter course to the northern shore,
opposite the bungalow. It looked as if they
had decided upon the former plan, which
would indicate that they knew or suspected
nothing of the third canoe, nestling somewhere
under the overhanging limbs along
shore.</p>

<p>Such undoubtedly would have been the
action of the tramps, had not it changed
so abruptly and inexplicably that the
astounded doctor ceased paddling and stared
without speaking a word.</p>

<p>Since our friends sat with their faces
toward the backs of Biggs and Hutt, they
saw their every movement no matter how
slight. Hutt was idle, with a grimy hand
resting on either gunwale of the canoe.
Now and then he glanced back and when he
saw the pursuers steadily falling behind,
had the impudence to reach out one hand
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
and beckon them to move faster. The other,
knowing he could not be overtaken, showed
little interest in those who were striving
to come up with him. Something far in
advance seemed to hold his attention.</p>

<p>Such was the situation, and the forward
boat was within a furlong of the western
shore when Biggs suddenly held his paddle
suspended as if he had caught sight of some
object that startled him. The next moment
he flung aside the implement, uttered a cry
of terror and dived overboard. Hutt was
not five seconds behind him. Both stayed
so long under water that our friends suspected
they were drowned, but the frowsy
heads, one without a hat, bobbed up at
some distance from the boat, and they were
seen swimming furiously toward the northern
bank, which was not far off.</p>

<p>They had not taken a dozen strokes when
they dived again and went as far under the
surface as before. Thus diving, swimming
and working desperately, they quickly
reached land, scrambled out, plunged in
among the trees and vanished as if Death
himself were nipping at their heels. Never
was greater panic shown.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span></p>

<p>Doctor Spellman sat mute and motionless
until the tramps had disappeared.
Then he turned his head:</p>

<p>“What do you make of that, Mike?”</p>

<p>The occasion was one of the rare ones
when the Irish youth had nothing to say.
He sighed and shook his head; he couldn’t
do justice to the theme.</p>

<p>“Something scared both of them out of
their wits. It couldn’t have been on the
shore ahead, for that’s too far off, nor on
their right, for they tried with might and
main to reach land there.”</p>

<p>“Could it have been at the rear?” ventured
Mike.</p>

<p>“That is toward us. <span class='it'>We</span> couldn’t have
caused them such alarm.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hutt may have looked around and
catched the frown on me brow; I’m towld
I have a tumble exprission when I’m mad.”</p>

<p>“It must be true to cause them thus to
leap into clear spring water, knowing it
meant the coldest kind of a bath. No,
Mike,” added the doctor gravely, “they
saw something <span class='it'>in the water</span> that threw them
into fits. What could it be?”</p>

<p>This was the only theory possible and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
yet it simply deepened the mystery. What
could there be in the clear cool waters of
Gosling Lake, besides the different species
of ordinary fishes that are taken with hook
and line? To Mike and the doctor the
puzzle was more inexplainable than before.</p>

<p>One conclusion, however, was warranted
by what had occurred: if the tramps had
seen something which terrified them beyond
imagination, what was to prevent the man
and youth from gaining a sight of the same
frightful object whatever it might be?</p>

<p>Now, while it cannot be denied that Dr.
Spellman and Mike Murphy were more
than ordinarily brave, yet they felt a shrinking
in stealing up to the spot where the
tramps had dived from the other canoe.
It was their ignorance of the character of
the peril which affected them more than
any tangible danger could have done.</p>

<p>The doctor dipped his paddle in the
water and gently swayed it. The boat
moved slowly toward the other canoe,
drifting like an eggshell over the placid
surface. In leaping overboard, Buzby
Biggs had flung the paddle from him and it
was seen floating a couple of rods distant
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
from the boat. Very slowly the doctor
advanced until Mike leaned over and lifted
the implement into their craft. Then the
man sheered his boat beside the other and
Mike, tossing the paddle into it, held it
steady, and sat down.</p>

<p>“Now, docther, we can manage it, I’m
thinking,” remarked the youth, looking up
into the face that it seemed to him had gone
a little pale.</p>

<p>“Can you find anything to explain the
fright of the tramps, Mike?”</p>

<p>Both peered into the clear water, whose
depth was too great for them to see the
bottom, but nothing rewarded their piercing
scrutiny. And right here a fact must
be admitted which was not discreditable
to either of them. The breath of air that
sighed over the lake had swept the empty
canoe fully a hundred feet from whence
it was at the moment Buzby Biggs dived
overboard. It followed, therefore, that
when Mike and the doctor peered into the
pellucid depths, it was not at the spot where
the tramps had descried something which
unnerved them. Moreover, each of the
pursuers knew such was the case, but did
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
not try to correct it nor did either drop a
hint of his knowledge until some time
afterward.</p>

<p>It may be added that had the doctor and
his young friend paddled a little farther
in the proper direction they would have
solved the mystery and been overcome
probably by the same panic that had driven
the tramps overboard.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the physician, “there is
nothing to be gained by staying here. Let’s
go to my home, have supper and spend the
evening. I know my wife will be glad to
have you, and I suspect that Stubby feels
a little that way herself.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied Mike feelingly; “I
may as well confess that my main purpose
in going thither is to meet Sunbeam, as
the callers used to say regarding mesilf whin
they purtended they wanted to see dad
and mither.”</p>

<p>Paddling at a leisurely rate, they soon
drew the two canoes up the bank and
stepped out. Mike paused and looked back.</p>

<p>“Can there be any fear of thim spalpeens
poking round here while we’re not in sight?”</p>

<p>“It seems unlikely; since they tried that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
sort of thing they have been scared so fearfully
that I think they will avoid us.”</p>

<p>“Docther, what could it have been that
made them jump out of their boat and
swim and dive like two crazy persons?”</p>

<p>“I should give a good deal to be able
to answer that question, but I have no
more idea than you. Let us try to content
ourselves with the belief that like the cause
of Uncle Elk’s resentment toward me, it
will be made clear sooner or later.”</p>

<p>Before leaving the landing, as it may be
called, they scanned the surface of the lake.
The doctor generally carried his binoculars
and he traced the margin clear around
from their right back again to their left.
There stood the bungalow with the flag
idly drooping from the staff and several of
the Scouts were seen lounging at the front.
In no other direction was a sign of life
discerned.</p>

<p>“I cannot discover the other canoe,”
remarked Dr. Spellman, passing the glass
to Mike at his side. “If the boys had
returned, the boat would be in sight by
the bungalow; whoever used it, they are
still absent.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span></p>

<p>“They have landed and gone into the
woods to look after birds or to trace out
other kinds of trees. They will be back
before the set of sun.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, unless,” added the doctor
half in earnest, “they should receive the
same shock that struck Biggs and Hutt.”</p>

<p>“In that evint, they will be home still
earlier.”</p>

<p>“Come on; I’m beginning to feel hungry.”</p>

<p>“And I’m wid ye there.”</p>

<h1  id='chIV'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>CHAPTER IV — Curious Sights And Doings</h1>

<p>One of the incidents which made
that night memorable in the life of
Mike Murphy was that it brought
him a compliment, the equal of which he had
never received before, nor in the years to
come can any similar words so touch his
heart.</p>

<p>Ruth Spellman, or “Sunbeam” as she
was coming to be called, was so interested in
his fairy stories that when the time arrived
for her to go to bed she was restless and
the mother feared it was something in the
nature of a fever that disturbed her. The
father, however, assured his wife that it
was due to mental excitement and would
soon pass away. When Ruth had said her
prayers, kissed each good night and lain
down on her cot, with the thin blanket
spread over her, she still fidgeted. From
the next room the three heard her tossing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
as children will do when sleep fails to soothe
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard her pleading voice:</p>

<p>“Cousin Mike, won’t you please sing to
me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my bist,” he replied with a laugh,
as he walked back and sat on a camp stool
beside her couch, where only a small portion
of the light from the front apartment
reached them. He began the baby song
with which his mother had often lulled him
to slumber in infancy. Its exquisite sweetness
was beyond description, the parents sat
motionless and listening as much enthralled
as the little one for whose benefit it was
sung. They were almost holding their
breath when Sunbeam murmured during one
of the slight pauses:</p>

<p>“I think one of the angels you told me
about, mamma, is singing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” whispered the father;
“I never heard anything like it.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the child had drifted
away into dreamland and Mike came forward
and joined the two on the outside.
They sat silent for a few minutes. Neither
referred to the wonderful treat they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
enjoyed, for it would have grated when compared
with the simple words of Sunbeam.
Nor did Mike speak of it, but, as has been
said, his heart had been touched as never
before.</p>

<p>It was comparatively early in the evening
when he bade his friends good-by,
having declined their invitation to stay
over night, and walked down to the water,
accompanied by the doctor.</p>

<p>“When you next see Uncle Elk, assure
him that his wishes shall be respected by
me; I shall not call at the bungalow in the
evening unless you signal for me, nor do
I intend to go near his home.”</p>

<p>Mike promised to carry out the doctor’s
wishes and turned the prow of the boat
south, which was the most direct course
home. He glanced back, and observing
that his friend had gone up the path, made
a change of direction, his action showing
that he did not wish the doctor to notice it.</p>

<p>The truth was that Mike was obsessed
with what he had witnessed that afternoon.
There must be an explanation of the fright
of the two tramps, but he could not frame
any theory that would stand for a moment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span></p>

<p>“And I’ll niver be able to do it,” he muttered,
“till I larn a good deal more than I
know now, which isn’t anything at all, as
Ted Ryan replied whin his taycher asked
him what he knowed about his lesson.”</p>

<p>Now, as that which terrified Biggs and
Hutt seemed to have appeared in the lake
near them, it would seem that there was the
spot to look for the solution of the mystery,
and yet it was impossible to hit upon the
precise place. He and the doctor had come
pretty near it some hours before, without
any result.</p>

<p>“We agraad that what the spalpeens saw
was <span class='it'>in the water</span>, but that couldn’t be. It
must have been on the land and that’s
where I’ll hunt for the same.”</p>

<p>There were just as strong objections to
this supposition, the chief of which was that
the vagrants when they went overboard
swam with frantic energy toward the shore;
in other words, they made for the point
where the terror was awaiting them. Moreover,
their actions in diving repeatedly and
glancing back proved that what they
dreaded was behind them.</p>

<p>It was useless to theorize, for the more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
Mike tried it, the more puzzled he became.
He decided to paddle slowly and silently to
the point where the tramps had landed and
make his investigations there. Using his
eyes and ears to the utmost, he ought to
learn something, provided always there was
something to learn. He certainly displayed
“nerve,” but no more than he had
done on other occasions.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the youth was
only an amateur in handing a canoe, but by
slowly and carefully moving the paddle, he
caused scarcely a ripple and was sure no
one could detect him through the sense of
hearing. There was no moon, but the sky
was clear and studded with stars whose
brilliancy enabled him dimly to see objects
at a distance of a hundred yards or so.
From the first, he kept so close inshore that
the undergrowth and wood were in sight
and served him as a guide. Even an expert
in the circumstances would not have been
able to decide precisely where Biggs and
Hutt left the water, but Mike was sure he
was not far from the spot when he ceased
plying his paddle.</p>

<p>He decided not to land, at least not for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
the present, but to halt where the bow of
the canoe rested directly under the dipping
branches. Thus, should it become necessary,
he could slip out of sight under the
leafy screen, or could retreat if it should
prove advisable to do so.</p>

<p>An overhanging bough rested on the prow
of the craft and held it motionless, a very
slight force serving as an anchor in the case
of so delicately poised a craft. First, with
his heart beating a little faster than usual,
he peered round in the gloom that shut him
in on every hand. To the southward he
saw the lights of the bungalow twinkling
like stars, one of the windows throwing the
rays well out on the lake, but in no other
direction could be noted a sign of life.</p>

<p>“Every one of the byes, not forgitting
Scout Master Hall, are there, for the ones
that wint out in t’other canoe must have
gone back while I was at the docther’s.
They know where I wint so they won’t be
worrying about me, which they wouldn’t
be likely to do annyhow,” he added with a
touch of his natural whimsicality, “if they
didn’t know anything about me at all, at
all.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span></p>

<p>No sound reached the intently listening
ears, except that deep almost inaudible
murmur which is never absent in a stretch
of forest or near the ocean.</p>

<p>“I’ll try it awhile, but if Mike Murphy
knows his own heart, which he thinks he
do, he isn’t going to sit in this steamboat
many more—whisht!”</p>

<p>From a point not fifty feet distant shot
out a canoe, like an arrow driven from a
bow. In it a single man was seated and
vigorously swinging the paddle. He had
emerged from under the overhanging limbs
and sped southward, absolutely without any
noise at all. Mike was so startled by the
apparition that he stared breathless for a
minute, nor did his wits fully come back
until the craft and its occupant were swallowed
up in the gloom.</p>

<p>Not only was the unexpected appearance
of the canoe startling, but the recognition
of the Master of Woodcraft who drove the
boat forward like a skimming swallow,
added to the amazement of Mike. Beyond
a doubt he was Uncle Elk. He was so near
when he first darted in view that there was
no possibility of mistake.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder ef I’m Mike Murphy or a big
fool or jest both,” muttered the youth,
when able to pull himself together. “I lift
Uncle Elk in his cabin studying his primer
or spelling book, and now he is in <span class='it'>this</span> part
of the world.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s reflection the youth
added:</p>

<p>“Which the same may be said of mesilf,
so that don’t count. It looked to me as if
he was heading for the bungalow and an
interisting question comes before me: being
that I obsarved him, did he return the compliment
and obsarve <span class='it'>me</span>?”</p>

<p>After turning the question over in his
mind, Mike said to himself:</p>

<p>“If I kaap at this much longer I’ll go
clean daft, as Jimmy Hagan did whin he
tried to whirl his two hands in opposite
directions at the same time. Can it be I’m
mistook?”</p>

<p>He sniffed the air several times and was
convinced that he caught the odor of a
burning cigar which could not be far off,
else the nose would not have detected it
when no wind was blowing.</p>

<p>“Uncle Elk doesn’t smoke, leastways I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
niver obsarved him doing the same, and if
he did he ain’t here, so the perfume can’t
be projuiced by him.”</p>

<p>He now ventured to draw his canoe nearer
shore, by gently pulling the overhanging
bough. It was blankly dark all around
him, the foliage shutting out the star gleam,
so that he had literally to feel his way.
Suddenly there was a slight jar, proving
that the bow had touched shore. He
paused to consider whether anything was
likely to be gained by leaving the craft.
While it seemed almost certain that Uncle
Elk had come to this lonely spot to meet
some one, there was no obvious way by
which Mike could assure himself on the
point.</p>

<p>He still noted the aroma of the cigar,
which he judged to be a pretty fair specimen
of the weed, though he was so accustomed
to the pipe of his father that he was
a poor judge.</p>

<p>“The spalpeen can’t be fur off,” concluded
Mike still gently sniffing, “and
begorra! he isn’t!”</p>

<p>The exclamation was caused by the sound
of a voice, not in speaking, but in chortling,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
as if pleased over something. The sound
was so near that had there been the least
illumination Mike must have seen the one
from whom it came. Then a second person—as
the peculiar sound proved—joined
in the ebullition, the two so near together
that otherwise the listener would have
thought the laugh came from one.</p>

<p>“It’s them tramps!” was the thought of
the startled Mike; “though one of ’em
wouldn’t be smoking a cigar unless he stole
it or Uncle Elk had give the same to him.”</p>

<p>It was unpleasant thus to associate the
hermit with the pestiferous vagrants with
whom the youth had had much trouble
already. He waited for the strangers to
speak, but they did not seem to care to do
so. Once he thought he saw the glowing
end of the cigar, but was probably mistaken,
for a second look failed to reveal it,
nor did either of the men laugh again.</p>

<p>With a feeling akin to disgust, Mike
stealthily worked his canoe from under the
overhanging boughs and set out on his
return to the clubhouse.</p>

<h1  id='chV'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>CHAPTER V — Concerning Certain American Trees</h1>

<p>As Mike Murphy approached the
landing he saw the second canoe
drawn up the beach, which was
proof that his friends had returned from
their excursion to the western end of the
lake. The bright light from the main room
of the clubhouse showed that the Boy
Scouts were gathered there and he decided
to go in.</p>

<p>The night was so mild that no fire
burned on the broad hearth, but the suspended
lamp filled the apartment with a
soft illumination which served almost as
well as midday. Jack Crandall, the hero
of the broken leg, sat in his invalid chair in
front of the fireplace and at his side was
Uncle Elk. Jack had been listening to the
reports of his young friends who had been
investigating trees, but were mostly interested
in bird lore. The comments which
Jack made on the written notes as read to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
him showed that he was the best informed
of any of the Scouts concerning birds. He
cleared up many doubts and answered
questions so intelligently that the venerable
Instructor in Woodcraft complimented him.</p>

<p>Mike came through the open door so
silently that none of the boys noticed him.
No chair being available, he sat down on the
floor, as the majority had already done.
He was near the entrance and aimed to
avoid observation, but as Uncle Elk from
his position faced him it was probable he
noticed the lad, as did Jack Crandall, who
also fronted that direction.</p>

<p>The reports and the comments thereon
having been finished, the old man was
speaking:</p>

<p>“To make satisfactory progress in acquiring
knowledge,” said he in his low, musical
voice to which all listened with alert interest,
“you must do so systematically. In
our tramp through the woods the other
day we picked up a good deal of information,
but it was haphazard. We talked of
trees as we came across them, but it was
fragmentary and ten times as much was
left unlearned as was learned. I am glad
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
to know that your Scout Master has followed
the right course in directing your
study of our native trees, not alone in Maine
but as far north as Canada, westward to
the Rockies and down to the northern boundaries
of the Southern States. The subject
is too vast for us to cover in one evening
or in a dozen evenings. Let us rather
summarize. We shall put our wits together
and see how many families we can name,
without giving the different species under
each. The first is the magnolia family, of
which there are four varieties, while under
the custard apple there is but one, the
papaw. Now let me hear from you.”</p>

<p>Nearly an hour was spent during which
scarcely a boy in the room kept silent. The
pleased old man nodded his head and
finally raised his hand for quiet.</p>

<p>“I believe you have mentioned about
all. Now, while Isaac jots down the names
at the table, let’s try to evolve something
like order therefrom. Are you ready?”</p>

<p>Isaac Rothstein nodded and held his lead
pencil over the paper. Here is the list upon
which all finally agreed:</p>

<p>Magnolia, custard-apple, linden, rue,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
ailantus, holly, staff-tree, buckthorn, rose,
pea, sumach, maple, horse chestnut, heath,
honeysuckle, dogwood, ginseng, witch hazel,
ebony, olive, begonia, laurel, mulberry, elm,
plane-tree, walnut, birch, beech, willow,
pine, yew and oak.</p>

<p>“None of you has seen all of these,”
continued the old man, “but I hope you
will have the opportunity of studying their
peculiarities sometime. To illustrate what
a rich treat is before you, we shall give a
few minutes’ attention to the oak family,
concerning which you may think I had considerable
to say the other day. Let me
show you how much was left unsaid.</p>

<p>“Most persons think of the oak as a slow
grower. This is true of two or three species
but not of the family. The majority need
a hundred years to attain perfection and
they rarely bear acorns until twenty years
old. The acorn requires no protection in
order to mature, and those that are not
eaten by wild animals or trodden under foot
do their work well. The <span class='it'>quercus</span> is one of
the longest-lived trees.”</p>

<p>“What is the greatest age that they
attain, Uncle Elk?” asked Scout Master
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
Hall, one of the most interested in the
audience.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to say, but there is
little doubt that many of them flourish for
a thousand years. There are vigorous
oaks to-day in England that were old in
the time of William the Conqueror. The
famous White Oak of Hartford, in which
Captain Wadsworth hid the charter two
hundred and twenty-five years ago, was
several centuries old at the time, and it
was not until the summer of 1856 that a
windstorm brought it to the ground. While
it is one of the most valuable of the family,
the white oak is in danger of extinction,
because of its value as timber and on account
of the sweetness of its nuts, which makes
it a favorite with wild creatures that will
not eat the bitter acorns of other oaks.
You know the white oak is so called because
of the color of its bark, which however is
generally an ashen gray. Can any of you
tell me the name of the oak that is fifty
feet or slightly more in height, grows in
Texas, has a fine-checked bark nearly the
color of the white oak, with an awkward
form and has shoots along the whole length
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
of its branches, with the leaves coarse and
rough on both sides? I shall not wait for
you to guess the name, which is the post
oak.</p>

<p>“The bur oak grows to a height of a
hundred and fifty feet and ranges south to
Texas and from the foothills of the Rockies
to the Atlantic coast, being most abundant
in Kansas and Nebraska. One of J. Fenimore
Cooper’s most pleasing tales is ‘The
Oak Openings,’ a name applied to the scattered
forests of Minnesota. Now, you may
know that the cork of commerce is the outer
bark of an oak growing in southern Europe.
The bur oak seems to be striving to produce
the same thing and probably will succeed
after awhile.</p>

<p>“The chestnut oak sometimes reaches a
height of a hundred feet, but the trunk
divides into large limbs a few feet above the
ground. It is found in this State, westward
through Ohio and as far south as Kentucky.
It has many features in common
with the yellow oak, whose range is somewhat
different.</p>

<p>“The dwarf chinkapin, or scrub chestnut
oak, is a shrub rarely more than a dozen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
feet high and grows on sandy or rocky soil.
We do not meet with it north of Massachusetts.
In Missouri and Kansas, it
acquires dimensions more like a tree.</p>

<p>“The swamp white oak grows to a height
of more than a hundred feet, and is fond of
the borders of swamps. The top is narrow
and round and the branches pendulous.
You know about the red oak, which is a
rapid grower and ranges from this State to
Georgia and westward to Kansas, but
attains its finest development north of the
Ohio.</p>

<p>“To continue, I should add the names of
the scarlet oak, the black and the yellow
oak, the pin oak, the swamp Spanish, the
bear, the scrub, the black jack, the barren,
the shingle, the laurel, and the willow.</p>

<p>“You have noticed that I have done
little more than mention the names of the
different species. You have learned very
little, for it is necessary that you should
know the range of each, the height to which
it grows, the characteristics of the bark, the
wood, the leaves, the flowers and acorns.
In conclusion, I shall say that the willow
oak is one of the most interesting of trees.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
Its leaves resemble those of the willow, as
do the straight slender shoots. It grows
on the wet borders of swamps, but keeps
away from the sea coast. Its acorns are
very small, with a kernel so bitter that you
would never bite into it a second time.</p>

<p>“My object this evening,” said Uncle
Elk, “has been rather to awaken a desire
on your part to study systematically our
common American trees than to give you
actual information. Let us dismiss the
subject, for in dropping a matter of that
kind we should follow the rule in eating,
which is to stop before the appetite is
cloyed. Suppose to-morrow night we have
a little talk about American birds.”</p>

<p>There was general nodding of heads
and the old man rose to his feet. He was
so pleased with his listeners that he said:</p>

<p>“If we get through that subject in time,
I’ll promise to tell you a story, provided
you would like to hear one from me.”</p>

<p>He could be seen smiling behind his
abundant gray beard.</p>

<p>“Boys will be boys always. Nothing
suits them better than a story. So I shall
bid you good night for the present, hoping
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
nothing will interfere with our meeting
again to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p>“The better plan,” suggested Scout Master
Hall, “is for you to take supper with us,
for I foresee that there will be much for
you to tell us. We don’t want to miss the
talk about birds, and I am as eager as the
boys to hear your story, which I know will
be a good one.”</p>

<p>All crowded around the Instructor in
Woodcraft, shaking hands, thanking him
and urging him so warmly to accept the
invitation that he could not refuse. The
last one with whom he clasped hands was
Jack Crandall, who straightened up in his
easy chair and declared he was receiving
more benefit than a dozen doctors could
impart.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy had risen to his feet at
the close of the old man’s talk, but kept
his place by the door until Uncle Elk came
opposite. A nod of the hermit’s head told
Mike that he wished to speak with him
alone. The signal was observed by several
who stayed behind as the two passed
out and down the porch to the beach.
Uncle Elk did not speak until they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
beyond the hearing of the others. Then
he halted and looked into the face of the
youth.</p>

<p>“Well, Michael, what word do you bring
me?”</p>

<p>“I told the docther what ye said and he
is agreeable. He will not come to the bungalow
in the evening unless we signal for
him, which the same doesn’t seem to be
likely.”</p>

<p>“That is what I wanted to know, and I
thank you for your service. Well, my son,
did you learn anything to-night?”</p>

<p>The youth was not sure of the scope of
the question.</p>

<p>“If ye ask whither I larned anything
from your words to the byes, I may say I
picked up a good deal more than I iver
knowed, which wasn’t much.”</p>

<p>“I refer to what you did after leaving the
home of Dr. Spellman and paddling to the
upper side of the lake.”</p>

<p>“Did ye obsarve me?” asked the astonished
Mike.</p>

<p>“How could I help it, when I passed
within a few feet of you in my own boat?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice it whin I came ashore.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span></p>

<p>“I landed a little way up the beach, where
my boat now awaits me. You haven’t told
me whether you learned anything through
your scouting.”</p>

<p>“I saan no one but yersilf, but I heerd
them two tramps laughing over something
and I smelled the cigar that one of them
was smoking.”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t catch yer maaning, Uncle Elk,”
said the mystified Mike; “I sartinly sniffed
a cigar and heerd two men chuckling to
thimsilves.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t denied that, but they were
not the tramps you have in mind.”</p>

<p>“How can ye know the same for sartin?”</p>

<p>“I went to that spot on the shore to meet
those men; they are old acquaintances and
the name of neither is Biggs nor Hutt.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p>“It would be useless to name them, since
they are strangers to you.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t ye stay and inthrodooce
me?”</p>

<p>“I may do so one of these days, but I
gave you a chance to find out things for
yourself.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span></p>

<p>“And mighty little I larned,” remarked
Mike disgustedly; “if ye don’t mind,
would ye tell me what the mischief scared
thim two tramps to the extint that they
jumped out of the canoe they had stole and
took a bath in Gosling Lake?”</p>

<p>Uncle Elk was distinctly heard to chuckle.</p>

<p>“I had a talk with my two friends
regarding the incident and I don’t wonder
that they laughed even after I had left
them.”</p>

<p>“I faal like laughing mesilf, Uncle Elk,
and if ye’ll give me the same cause I’ll
laugh so hard that it will wake the docther’s
daughter on t’other side of the lake.”</p>

<p>“Have patience, Michael, and don’t
think I am trifling with you, but I am under
a promise not to reveal this little secret
until I have permission. Good night.”</p>

<p>Mike stood gazing after the old man until
he passed from sight in the obscurity and he
heard him launching his canoe. Then the
youth strolled thoughtfully back.</p>

<p>“I’m getting mixed,” he muttered with a
sigh, “as Jerry Lanagan said whin they
run him through a thrashing machine.”</p>

<h1  id='chVI'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>CHAPTER VI — A Patriot Martyr</h1>

<p>The next day brought a marked coolness
in the temperature. In preparation
for the evening’s instructive
entertainment, nearly all the boys spent
the time in roaming through the woods,
taking notes and brushing up their knowledge
of birds, which were met with only in
moderate numbers.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy told Alvin Landon and
Chester Haynes of his singular experience
the night before, and asked their help in
solving the puzzle.</p>

<p>“I wish we could aid you,” replied Alvin,
“but it is as much a mystery to us as it is
to you. Gordon Calhoun went with us in
the other canoe to the western end of the
lake, where we found so romantic a spot
that we ate our lunch there and did not
return until after dark.”</p>

<p>“And ye didn’t obsarve anything of thim
tramps and their dive overboord?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span></p>

<p>“We must have been deep in the woods
when that took place and, of course, we
noticed nothing strange when we paddled
back.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to pump Uncle Elk, but the
valves won’t work. I’m going to kaap at
it till I larn the truth or break a trace.”</p>

<p>“Count us in to give all the help we can,”
Alvin assured him.</p>

<p>That evening when the Boy Scouts gathered
in the large room of the bungalow and
disposed themselves in their free and easy
fashion, a moderate fire was burning on the
hearth and all were on the tiptoe of expectancy.</p>

<p>“My friends,” said Uncle Elk, “I am
going to ask your permission to reverse the
order which I laid out last night. Most of
us old persons are apt to forget that the
knowledge which interests us may not be
equally interesting to everyone else.
Although I cut short my talk about American
trees, it was still dry in some respects.
Now if I should start in concerning birds
you would by and by become weary. Oh,
you needn’t shake your heads. I don’t forget
when I was a boy myself. So I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
decided to say nothing about our little
brothers of the air until to-morrow night,
when we shall consider nothing else. The
time now at my disposal is to be given to
the story I have in mind. If any one has
an objection to make let him do so now or
forever after hold his peace.”</p>

<p>He looked around in the bright faces as
if he really expected a protest instead of a
general series of smiles. Then with the
prefatory remark that the narrative which
he was about to give was true in every
respect, he spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“The cause of American independence
never looked more gloomy than in the summer
and autumn of 1776. Washington
with his famishing army was in the city of
New York, preparing for the attack that he
knew would soon be made by the British
fleet and land forces. The American fortifications
extended from the ferry station of
Brooklyn and Gowanus Bay to Wallabout
Bay (now Brooklyn Navy Yard), less than
a mile and a half in length. Generals
Sullivan and Stirling were in command, with
five thousand miserably equipped troops.
Unfortunately that fine officer General
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
Greene was ill with a violent fever, and the
boastful Sullivan assumed charge, but
Washington soon replaced him with General
Putnam. By a fatal oversight, one of
the three roads over any of which the enemy
could advance if it was unguarded, was left
invitingly open. Through this the British
soldiers rushed and drove the Americans
pell-mell out of their intrenchments.</p>

<p>“Had Howe flung off his natural indolence,
he would have captured the whole
patriot army, including Washington and his
officers, but certain of soon doing so, he
wished to save the lives of his men. The
Americans had several hundred killed and
lost a thousand prisoners, among the latter
being Generals Sullivan and Stirling. The
leading officers were soon exchanged, but
the privates suffered horribly in the hideous
Sugar House and rotten hulks at Wallabout.</p>

<p>“A strange providence saved the Continental
army. The fleet was checked by
adverse winds, and a dense fog settled over
Brooklyn, but did not touch the other shore.
Thus hidden from sight, the Americans stole
back to New York, unseen by the enemy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span></p>

<p>“But, as I said, the outlook could not
have been more gloomy. The situation
was critical to the last degree. The army
was so demoralized that little discipline
remained; whole companies deserted; the
few recruits who came into camp met double
their number going out; those who stayed
clamored for their pay, and the money
chest was as empty as an egg shell. Winter
was coming on, and more than once it
looked as if the army would dwindle to
nothing. The fourteen thousand troops
declared fit for duty were strung the whole
length of Manhattan Island.</p>

<p>“The crisis was imminent and Washington
called a council of war September
7th, to decide whether New York should be
abandoned or defended. The commander,
seeing the dread necessity coming, had
asked Congress if he should not burn the
city rather than allow it to serve as the
winter quarters of the invaders. He was
ordered to use special care to prevent any
damage being done, because that body was
sure the place would soon be recovered.
The first council of war decided to stay and
defend New York.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span></p>

<p>“A few days later, however, another
council agreed that the only course possible
was to leave the city and take position
on Harlem Heights. The public stores
were to be sent to Dobbs Ferry and the
sick carried across to New Jersey. The
main army would march northward and
General Putnam would stay in New York
with four thousand troops. If he found
his position untenable, he was to follow
Washington.</p>

<p>“At this council the commander-in-chief
said:</p>

<p>“‘I know absolutely nothing of the
intentions of the enemy. Two ships-of-war
have gone up the East River and others
will follow. Their troops are active everywhere,
but I cannot even guess what they
mean to do. Until I have knowledge on
that point, I am helpless.’</p>

<p>“In his distressful dilemma, Washington
wrote to General Heath at Kingsbridge,
entreating him and General Clinton to aid
in securing the indispensable information.
He told them to spare no expense or pains,
adding that not since the beginning of the
war had he been so uneasy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span></p>

<p>“Shortly after, Washington called his
officers together again. He told them he
was still without the least knowledge of the
plans of the enemy. Only one recourse
remained to him:—that was to send a spy
into the British lines in quest of the information.
Such a man must be clear-headed,
cool, tactful, a good draughtsman and of
undaunted courage. He appealed to Lieutenant-Colonel
Knowlton (soon to die the
death of a patriot) to find him the person.
Knowlton laid the request before a conference
of his officers, and asked whether
any one was willing to volunteer.</p>

<p>“A spy is very different from a scout and
in the eyes of most people is the most contemptible
of creatures, for the essence of
his duty is treachery. To succeed he must
play the hypocrite and betray confidence at
every turn. In such scorn is a spy held
by civilized nations that he is not permitted
to die the death of a soldier, but is
hanged like the worst of felons.</p>

<p>“The request of Knowlton was succeeded
by an indignant hush. The bronzed
faces flushed as if under the sting of an
insult, and the officers dared not trust
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
themselves to reply. In the midst of the
strained silence, a clear voice spoke:</p>

<p>“‘I will go!’</p>

<p>“Every eye was turned in astonishment
on the speaker. He was a young man of
athletic figure and handsome face, whose
paleness was due to a severe illness from
which he was hardly yet recovered. He
wore the uniform of a captain, and in the
whole army there was not a braver or more
beloved officer than he. His words caused
a painful shock to his comrades, who,
believing a disgraceful death was certain to
follow his mad attempt, closed around him
and protested in the most forceful language
at their command. To all their appeals
he smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“‘Gentlemen, it is useless. I am touched
by your friendship, but all the arguments
you bring forward have already been considered
by me. A spy is looked upon with
loathing, but the necessity of one’s country
makes every kind of service honorable. I
am not seeking promotion or pecuniary
reward. I go to serve our cause, for which
I am ready at any time to give my life.’</p>

<p>“It was not the words alone, but their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
emphasis which silenced his comrades. They
saw it was useless to appeal to one whose
patriotism throbbed and burned through
his entire being, and inspired every thought,
word and deed.</p>

<p>“And who was the young officer who thus
took his life in his hands that he might
serve the cause of liberty?</p>

<p>“He was Captain Nathan Hale, born in
Connecticut, in 1755, the sixth child among
twelve, of the strictest Puritan parents.
His mental and athletic gifts were wonderful.
None of his playmates could approach
him in running, leaping, swimming, throwing,
wrestling and the feats of strength and
agility so much admired by all rugged
American youths. Many a time he would
place a row of empty barrels beside one
another and with little effort spring out of
one into the other until he had completed
the series. Standing beside a fence whose
top rail touched his chin, he would rest one
hand lightly on it and vault over as easily
as a deer. One day, while a student at
Yale, in a contest with his friends, he made
so prodigious a leap that the bounds were
carefully marked and preserved for years,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
the admiration and despair of all subsequent
students.</p>

<p>“But, extraordinary as was Nathan
Hale’s athletic skill, his mental powers were
more brilliant, while his social qualities
made him a favorite with all. His simplicity,
unfailing good nature and readiness
to help others, no matter whom, justified
the remark: ‘Every man, woman and child
who knew him were his friends and among
them not one was ever an enemy.’</p>

<p>“He entered Yale College when fifteen
years old and was graduated in due course
with the highest honors. This fact attests
his scholarship and ability. He was easily
the most popular student, not only with
his classmates, but with the tutors and the
faculty of the college and the best families
in New Haven.</p>

<p>“Hale left college in 1773 and engaged
in teaching. In 1774, he was made preceptor
in the Union Grammar School at
New London. The building is carefully
preserved and is well worth a visit. The
institution was of a high order, and its students
were not only grounded thoroughly in
an English education, but were prepared
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
for college. Hale was its first preceptor,
and his success was pronounced from the
beginning. Boys like you have admired
and always will admire physical prowess,
and there was never one among them all
who could approach their instructor in that
respect. What a star football player he
would have made in these later days!
Added to this ability, his mental and social
gifts and his profound religious nature
explain his marked success among the youth
of New London.</p>

<p>“On the 21st of April, 1775, a rider dashed
into the little town upon his foaming horse
and shouted the news of Lexington and
Concord. Pausing only long enough to
rest his panting steed and to snatch a bit
of food, he thundered away for New York
with his momentous tidings.</p>

<p>“Instantly New London flamed with
excitement. The bells were rung and a
‘town meeting,’ the inalienable recourse of
all New Englanders, was called at the court
house for early candle light. Seemingly the
whole town crowded thither. There were
burning speeches and Hale’s was the most
impassioned of all.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span></p>

<p>“The talking being over, he wrote down
his name as a volunteer. Others caught
the contagion and elbowed one another in
their eagerness to be among the first to
enlist. The next morning, when the boys
came together at the call of the school bell,
their teacher offered up an earnest prayer
for the success of the great struggle that
had opened, commended his pupils to the
care of their Heavenly Father, shook the
hands of each lad in turn, uttered a few
words of advice, and set out for Cambridge.
Some time later, he came back to New
London and resumed his duties in the school.</p>

<p>“The young patriot, however, could not
remain idle so long as his beloved country
needed her sons. He enlisted as a lieutenant
in Colonel Charles Webb’s regiment,
which had been raised by order of the General
Assembly of Connecticut for home
defense and, if needed, for national protection.
In September, the regiment marched
to Cambridge and took part in the siege of
Boston. Upon the departure of the British
for Halifax, the American army went to
New York. Some months later, when the
team of his company’s enlistment expired,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
Hale offered to give the men his month’s
pay if they would stay a little while longer.</p>

<p>“The Continentals had been in New
York but a short time when Hale became
the hero of a daring exploit. A British supply
vessel lay in the East River under the
protection of a frigate of sixty-four guns.
He obtained permission to attempt the
capture of the sloop. Selecting a few men
as brave as himself, they stepped into a
whale boat, rowed silently out late at night
and drew up beside the vessel undetected
by the watch. Like so many phantoms,
the boarders climbed over the side, seized
the sentinel, fastened the crew below the
hatches, lifted anchor and took the prize
into Coenties Slip, without raising the
slightest alarm. Day was breaking when
Hale, holding the helm, was recognized by
his friends, who received him with hurrahs.
For once at least his comrades enjoyed a
‘square meal.’</p>

<p>“In May, 1776, he became captain of a
company of Continental Rangers attached
to Lieutenant-Colonel Knowlton’s regiment,
called ‘Congress’ Own.’ The young officer’s
company was the best drilled and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
disciplined of all. Little is known of his
actions during those eventful days, but it
cannot be doubted that he did his duty
well. Illness kept him in New York at the
time the British invaded Long Island, and
still weak and pale, he joined the troops
who retreated toward Harlem Heights early
in September.</p>

<p>“This brings me back to the day when
Lieutenant-Colonel Knowlton walked into
the quarters of General Washington and
introduced Captain Hale as the officer who
had volunteered to serve him as a spy. The
commander looked admiringly into the blue
eyes of the handsome young athlete and
took his hand. The great man was moved
and feelingly thanked him for the inestimable
service he hoped he would render
his country. He saw without questioning
that Hale was the ideal actor for so perilous
a rôle. He gave him minute instructions,
with a written order to the owners of all
American vessels in Long Island Sound to
take him to any point on Long Island where
he might wish to go.</p>

<p>“Captain Hale left camp the same evening.
He took with him Sergeant Stephen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
Hempstead, a member of his company, who
was devoted to the officer, and a servant,
Ansel Wright. They had to walk fifty
miles to Norwalk before they found a safe
place to cross the Sound, because of the
British cruisers that were ever moving to
and fro. At this place, Hale took off his
regimentals and donned a brown cloth suit
and a broad-brimmed hat. He assumed
the character of a Quaker school teacher,
who had wearied of the society of the rebels
in New York and had started out to find a
situation among more congenial folk.</p>

<p>“The captain instructed his companions
to wait at Norwalk until the 20th, upon
which day he expected to come back. They
were to send a boat for him on that morning.
He left with them his uniform, his commission
and all other papers that might
betray his identity. He crossed the Sound
in a sloop and went ashore on the point of
Great Neck in Huntingdon Bay, being
rowed thither in a yawl. He landed near
a place called ‘The Cedars,’ not far from a
tavern kept by a widow named Chichester.
She was a spiteful Tory and the inn
was a lounging place for those of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
neighbors who were of the same mind. In the
gray light of early morning Hale walked
past without being noticed. A mile beyond,
he stopped at the farm house of William
Johnson, and obtained breakfast and a bed
for several hours’ rest. Thence he went
directly into the nearest British lines, where
he was received without suspicion. He
was gone for about two weeks, but what he
did, where he went, what adventures befell
him and the various means he used to escape
detection can never be known. It is certain
that he visited all the enemy’s encampments
near Brooklyn and twice passed their
lines. He made drawings and notes of what
he saw and learned; he went from Brooklyn,
then only a ferry station, to New
York City, which the British captured after
his departure, and was equally thorough in
every place. The drawings and memoranda,
the latter written in Latin, were
hidden under the loose inner soles of his
shoes.</p>

<p>“Having finished his work in New York,
Hale recrossed to Brooklyn and threaded
his way through the lines to Huntingdon.
By this time he felt so secure in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
disguise that he entered without hesitation
the tavern of Widow Chichester and sat
down among a group of loungers, with whom
he talked in his character of a Quaker school
teacher. He was happy over the thought
that his dangerous work was over and the
important knowledge he had gained would
soon be in the hands of General Washington.</p>

<p>“Among the strangers in the place was
one whose face seemed familiar to Hale,
but he could not recall where he had ever
met the man. He decided that the resemblance
was one of those accidental ones
that are occasionally seen, and he gave the
matter no further thought. By and by the
fellow, who silently studied the beaming
young Quaker, slipped out of doors and did
not return.</p>

<p>“Ah, why did Hale fail to see the sinister
meaning of all this? After escaping so
many perils, why did he not continue alert
and suspicious until safe within his own
lines? Sad to say, not a single misgiving
entered his thoughts, and after awhile he
bade the company good night and went to
his room.</p>

<p>“The next morning at dawn he walked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
to the bay to meet the boat that was to come
for him. With a thrill of delighted expectancy,
he saw a craft containing several
men approaching. He sprang lightly down
the bank and then suddenly stopped in consternation.
The boat was filled with British
marines under command of an officer!</p>

<p>“He whirled about to flee. Had he discovered
his peril sooner and gained a few
minutes’ start, no pursuer could have overtaken
him. But six muskets were leveled,
and he was ordered to surrender under
threat of instant death. He paused, came
down the bank again and stepped into the
boat, which was rowed out to the British
ship <span class='it'>Halifax</span>. There he was searched and
the fatal papers were found on him.</p>

<p>“The tradition is that the man in the
tavern who betrayed Hale was a distant
Tory relative who recognized him as soon
as he entered the place. Upon leaving the
inn, he went to a British naval officer in
Huntingdon Bay with the news.</p>

<p>“Captain Hale was taken to New York
on the 21st and brought before Lord Howe,
who read the documents that had been
captured with the prisoner. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
useless to try to conceal the truth and Hale
denied nothing. He said he wished no
court-martial and was ready to meet his
fate.</p>

<p>“Howe was naturally a kind-hearted man,
but just then he was greatly irritated over a
fire which had destroyed several hundred
houses in New York, and which he believed
had been started by the Americans to prevent
his use of them. He condemned Hale
to be hanged at daylight the next morning
and placed him in the custody of William
Cunningham, Provost Marshal and one of
the most brutal wretches that ever lived.
It is some consolation to know that this
miscreant was hanged himself some years
later for scores of confessed murders to
which he had been accessory. He thrust
Hale into a prison cell, and would not have
unpinioned him except for the intercession
of a British officer. When the prisoner
asked for the presence of a chaplain, it
was refused with curses, as was his request
for a Bible. The same friendly officer
obtained permission for Hale to write letters
to his mother, sisters and the girl to
whom he was betrothed. The missives
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
were handed to Cunningham to be forwarded.
With a leer he read each and then
tore them up and flung the fragments on
the floor. Hale looked scornfully at him
but did not speak.</p>

<p>“The next morning he was led to the
gallows, which was the limb of an apple
tree, exactly where is not known. In
accordance with the military custom of
those days, a ladder was placed under the
branch. The prisoner climbed two or
three rounds, when at a signal the support
was turned and he was left dangling in the
air. A moment before, he had looked down
in the faces of the hushed spectators and
uttered his last noble words:</p>

<p>“‘I only regret that I have but one life
to lose for my country!’</p>

<p>“No one knows where the martyr was
buried. On November 25, 1893, a statue
to his memory was unveiled in City Hall
Park, in the presence of a vast assemblage
and amid impressive ceremonies.”</p>

<h1  id='chVII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>CHAPTER VII — Concerning Certain New England Birds</h1>

<p>“One reason why I deferred our
talk about birds,” said Uncle
Elk, addressing the troop of Boy
Scouts who had gathered in the large room
of the bungalow the next evening, “is that
you might have more opportunity to
brighten up your knowledge on the subject.
Scout Master Hall tells me that when you
learned you were to spend your vacation in
southern Maine, you started in to inform
yourselves about the birds which are to be
found in New England. It is impossible
under the circumstances that you should
see them all, for the season is not the most
favorable and not even a majority are to
be found in this section. Instead of dealing
out a lot of facts, I am going to ask you
do it for me. Secretary Rothstein has
given me a list of all the Boy Scouts who
are present. There are too many of you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
for me to identify separately, so I shall call
upon you at random. I think,” he added
with a sly glance at the invalid on his right,
“that I shall except Jack, since he seems to
know all about our feathered inhabitants
and would be simply taking my place.</p>

<p>“Starting with Mr. Hall’s Patrol I call
upon his leader, Charles A. Chase, to name
the first order as it is generally accepted.”</p>

<p>The alert young man promptly arose and
said:</p>

<p>“It is the raptores, which means robbers.”</p>

<p>“What does it include?”</p>

<p>“The falcons proper, hawks, buzzard-hawks,
eagles, horned owls, gray owls and
day owls.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Corporal George Robe will
name the second order.”</p>

<p>The plump little fellow blushed but did
not hesitate.</p>

<p>“Scansores or climbers, which takes in
cuckoos and woodpeckers.”</p>

<p>“The third order is so numerous that I
can hardly expect any one to remember
the complete list. Will Kenneth Henke
name the third order?”</p>

<p>“Insessores or perchers.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span></p>

<p>“I will ask Kenneth Mitchell, Robert
Snow and Ernest Oberlander to help you
in making out a complete catalogue.”</p>

<p>While these boys did well, they would
not have succeeded but for the aid of Colgate
Craig and Robert Rice. Even then
Uncle Elk had to supply several names, for
the long list included humming birds, goatsuckers,
screamers, kingfishers, flycatchers,
singers, thrushes, mocking birds, wrens,
warblers, tanagers, swallows, shrikes, skylarks,
sparrows, orioles, blackbirds, crows,
jays and some others less known.</p>

<p>Alvin Landon had an easy task with the
rasores or scratchers, which embrace the
doves, game birds such as the Canada
grouse, spruce partridge, pinnated grouse,
ruffed grouse improperly called the partridge,
Virginia partridge, quail and Bob
White.</p>

<p>Chester Haynes gave the fifth order as
grallatores or waders, which with its herons,
shore birds, plovers, snipes, sandpipers and
others are known to every one.</p>

<p>The sixth and last order as named by
Hubert Wood was the natores or swimmers,
with the principal of which every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
American boy is familiar. Hubert, with the
assistance of Harold Hopkins, named swans,
geese, several kinds of ducks, gulls, terns,
divers, loons and grebes.</p>

<p>“That is a pretty full list,” commented
Uncle Elk, “but it may be that Michael
has some other waders in mind.”</p>

<p>“That I hev,” responded the Irish youth
springing to his feet; “the first time Alvin
and Chester tried to paddle a canoe it
tipped over wid ’em—they lacking the
sense I showed—and the water not being
deep the same was waders for the time.”</p>

<p>Mike did not smile as he resumed his
seat on the floor, though every one else did.</p>

<p>“Let me remind you,” added Uncle Elk,
“that we have simply named the six
orders, without any attempt to particularize.
To illustrate will you name a bird?”</p>

<p>Some one called:</p>

<p>“Let’s talk about the thrush.”</p>

<p>“Very well; its head is a clear cinnamon
brown, the under parts white, sometimes
tinged with buff on the breast and thickly
marked beneath except on the chin and
throat. The sides of the head are a dark
brown, streaked with white, with maxillary
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
streaks on each side of the throat. It is a
trifle over eight inches long, the wings being
a little more than half of that, and the eggs
are usually four in number, of a uniform
light-blue color, without spots and showing
a slight tint of green.</p>

<p>“The song thrush is common in Rhode
Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts, but
is not often seen in the other New England
States. I have had persons say they saw
and heard them in this section, when it was
either the hermit or olive-backed thrush.
You may look for their return from the
South about the tenth of May, the two
sexes coming at the same time.</p>

<p>“The great charm of the thrush is its
wonderful voice. Hardly has it arrived
when you hear the sweet notes of the male
at early dawn or when twilight is coming on.
Very rarely is it heard in the middle of the
day, unless the sky is overcast. The best
description of that which cannot be
described is by Nuttall, which so impressed
me when I first read it that I have never
forgotten the words. He says:</p>

<p>“‘The prelude to this song resembles
almost the double-tonguing of the flute,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
blended with a tinkling, shrill, and solemn
warble, which re-echoes from his solitary
retreat like the dirge of some recluse, who
shuns the busy haunts of life. The whole
air consists usually of four parts, or bars,
which succeed in deliberate tune, finally
blending together in impressive and soothing
harmony, becoming more mellow and
sweet at every repetition. Rival performers
seem to challenge each other from various
parts of the wood, vying for the favor of
their mates with sympathetic responses and
softer tones. And some, waging a jealous
strife, terminate the warm dispute by an
appeal to combat and violence. Like the
robin and the thresher, in dark and gloomy
weather when other birds are sheltered and
silent, the clear notes of the wood thrush
are heard through the dripping woods from
dawn to dusk; so that the sweeter and more
constant is his song. His clear and interrupted
whistle is likewise often nearly the
only voice of melody heard by the traveler
to midday, in the heat of summer, as he
traverses the silent, dark and wooded wilderness,
remote from the haunts of men.’</p>

<p>“You have all been charmed by the music
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
of this bird and will agree that this description,
while it falls short of the reality, cannot
be excelled. Now, in your rambles you
have seen birds with gorgeous plumage;
which one do you consider the most beautiful
of all?”</p>

<p>After some discussion, the majority pronounced
in favor of the scarlet tanager.</p>

<p>“Most persons will agree with you, but
my preference is for what is popularly
known as the wood duck, which builds its
nests in trees and in size and habits resembles
the common duck. The colors shown in
the feathers of this bird to my mind are
simply bewildering in their beauty.</p>

<p>“But to return to the tanager. He is
found in all parts of New England but
more frequently in the southern portions.
A noticeable fact about this tanager is that
it seems to be extending its range. I hear
that it has been seen for the first time in
sections where those familiar with its habits
never expected to find it. Will Arthur
Mitchell tell me when it arrives from the
South and about its nesting?”</p>

<p>The lad appealed to rose and replied:</p>

<p>“It comes north about the middle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
May, looks around for two weeks or so and
then begins building its nest. It prefers
oak groves situated near swamps. The
nest is placed on the horizontal limb of a
tree not more than twenty feet above
ground.”</p>

<p>“What of the eggs?”</p>

<p>“They vary from three to five in number,
and are of a light greenish blue with
spatters of purplish brown. It belongs to
the order of perehers.”</p>

<p>“Is the tanager a useful bird?”</p>

<p>“It is; the males destroy thousands of
insects and though the song isn’t noteworthy,
it is pleasant to hear.”</p>

<p>“Will Gordon Calhoun give a general
description of this bird?”</p>

<p>“The wings and tail of the male are like
black silk velvet, but the main color is a
brilliant blood red. The female wears a
more sober dress.”</p>

<p>When the rambling talk had continued
for some time longer, Scout Master Hall
asked Uncle Elk to tell them something
about bird migration.</p>

<p>“That is an interesting subject over which
I with thousands have speculated and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
theorized without learning much. It is easy to
understand why the geese from the extreme
north hike south with the approach of the
arctic winter, and why many others in more
temperate latitudes do the same, coming
north with the return of spring, but some
of the migrations are beyond explanation.
I should like to ask what birds make the
longest flights?”</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall and Jack Crandall
expressed their views, but the old man
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Since all of you did no more than guess,
it was a waste of time. Now follow me
closely. We have no large maps here to
place on the wall for you to study, but you
have a fair knowledge of geography and can
draw a mental map that will serve. Picture
a map of the western hemisphere.
Have you done so?”</p>

<p>A general nodding of heads.</p>

<p>“You didn’t nod, Mr. Hall.”</p>

<p>“I have the map before my mind’s eye,”
replied the Scout Master; “I am following
you.”</p>

<p>“Since the discovery of the North Pole,
you have all become familiar with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
contour of the polar regions. Locate the Arctic
Islands in, say seventy-five degrees
north latitude; then draw an imaginary line
from those islands down along the coast of
Labrador, across to Newfoundland, and
down to Nova Scotia, then over the Atlantic
to the Lesser Antilles in the West Indies,
from there to Brazil and across Argentina
and end your line in Patagonia at the
extremity of South America.</p>

<p>“You have mentally swept over a tremendous
stretch of country and water, but
are not yet through. Push on westward to
the Pacific, northward up the coast, then
across Central America and up the Mississippi
Valley, through central Canada and
back to the Arctic Islands from which you
started. Truly a long journey and yet it
is the yearly itinerary of the American
golden plover, which, measured in miles, is
three-fifths of the distance round the world.”</p>

<p>“You have mentioned one of the most
remarkable facts in natural history,” commented
Mr. Hall, who, like every listener,
was deeply impressed.</p>

<p>“Quite true,” replied Uncle Elk, “though
there are many equally inexplicable. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
have sometimes fancied that birds resemble
men in their longing for travel. With
means of locomotion at their command still
far beyond the skill of our best aviators,
what wonder that our little brothers of the
air are impelled to gather the best that can
be secured?</p>

<p>“This, however, is a fanciful theory
which the naturalists will not accept. It
must be remembered that the majority of
golden plovers who start on this long journey
never complete it, for almost every
mile is attended with danger. They are
dazzled by the vivid electric lights of the
cities, and confused by the tall buildings,
telephone and telegraph wires, especially on
dark nights when the birds fly low. Thousands
are thus killed, besides which adverse
gales blow many out to sea, and blizzards
and snowstorms destroy myriads.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we have talked enough about
birds,” said Uncle Elk, “but I shall be glad
to answer any questions that may occur to
you.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence, Mike Murphy
rose to his feet. His face, as usual, was
serious even when about to indulge in some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
of his waggeries, but this time he was in
earnest.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s mesilf that knows mighty
little about birds excipt them as is met with
in Ireland, which isn’t many. There is
one that I once heerd of that belongs to
anither counthry.”</p>

<p>“Describe it, Michael,” remarked the old
man indulgently.</p>

<p>“It has the bill of a duck, webbed feet,
lays eggs, has a furry body and I belave is
what is called a mammal. It’s a mighty
qu’ar bird that I’d like to know the name
of.”</p>

<p>In answer to the general smiles Uncle Elk
asked:</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen one of the creatures,
Michael?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of, though I have
often made search for ’em.”</p>

<p>“Michael has described no fancy creation.
Such a thing exists. Can any one
tell me its name?”</p>

<p>Isaac Rothstein replied:</p>

<p>“It is the ornithorhynchus or water mole
of Australia, but it is not classed as a bird.”</p>

<p>“No, although there seems to be some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
reason why it should be. You see what a
limitless field opens before you when you
leave the American continent to make
investigations elsewhere. For a long time
to come we shall find our hands full in our
own country.”</p>

<p>“What about the birds that are called
<span class='it'>Indians</span>?” gravely asked Mike.</p>

<p>“There are some facts regarding Maine
Indians which are worth remembering. In
1612, they numbered 38,000. At the close
of the French and Indian War this number
had been reduced to a thousand, which is
the aboriginal population to-day. The
decrease was due to the fierce wars which
the tribes waged among themselves. The
Indians in Maine were four times as numerous
as those in Massachusetts. The Pine
Tree State was the ‘dark and bloody
ground’ of colonial days.</p>

<p>“In a general way the tribes bore the
same names as rivers. Those west of the
Penobscot were of the Abnaki group, and
those to the east into New Brunswick called
themselves Etechemins. All belonged to
the Algonquin nation. When King Philip’s
War broke out in 1675, the Maine Indians
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
numbered about 12,000. This was twice
the white population and sufficient to wipe
out the settlements nearly to the New
Hampshire border. Finally, in 1759, the
Indians in Maine did not number more
than a thousand. They were mainly
Penobscots and Passamaquoddies. They
remained faithful to the Americans throughout
the Revolution. It is a curious fact
that while the Passamaquoddies have
decreased in number during the last ninety
years, the Penobscots have increased to the
extent of seven, the former being slightly
more numerous. Both keep up their tribal
conditions, and the Penobscots live in the
same village site that their forefathers
occupied before the white men set foot on
the continent.”</p>

<h1  id='chVIII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>CHAPTER VIII — A Council of War</h1>

<p>That night, after Uncle Elk had left
the bungalow, Alvin Landon, Chester
Haynes and Mike Murphy held
what Alvin called a council of war.</p>

<p>Sauntering a little way from the building,
they sat down in the silent depths of
the woods where no one could overhear what
was said by them. Not that a Boy Scout
would be guilty of eavesdropping, but it
was best that no inkling of what was in
the air should become accidentally known
to others.</p>

<p>Without quoting all the conversation, let
me make clear its substance. The three
were so mystified by the incidents already
told that they determined not to cease
their efforts until the puzzle was solved.
They were the only Boy Scouts who knew
the particulars, and it was natural that
their friends should give their chief interest
to fishing, rambling in the forest, studying
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
trees, picking up what they could of natural
history, and laying in unnecessary stores of
health and strength.</p>

<p>One thing was certain: Uncle Elk knew
the secret and he wouldn’t tell. More than
that, Chester Haynes startled his chums by
the declaration:</p>

<p>“So does Mr. Hall,—at least I am pretty
sure he does.”</p>

<p>“What reason have you for thinking
that?” asked the astonished Alvin.</p>

<p>“I have seen them more than once whispering
in a way that showed they were
keenly interested.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything that either
said?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>“How do you know then to what they
were referring?”</p>

<p>“I don’t; I’m only guessing.”</p>

<p>“I belave ye’re right,” added Mike; “I
obsarved the same thing and had the same
’spicion, and would have spoke of it if
Chest hadn’t got ahead of me. But I’m
thinking that if Mr. Hall knows it all, why
the mischief doesn’t he tell us afore we
bust?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span></p>

<p>“For the simple reason that Uncle Elk
has bound him to secrecy. No; what we
find out must be done without the help of
either.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll doot!” exclaimed Mike, “or
we’ll break a trace trying.”</p>

<p>“How shall we go about it?” asked Alvin.
“Whatever we do must be done without
either of them, especially Uncle Elk, knowing
it.”</p>

<p>“And there’s the rub.”</p>

<p>Bring three bright-witted boys together
and let them concentrate their mental
energies upon the solution of a problem,
and even if they don’t succeed, they are
sure to evolve something worth while.</p>

<p>“It is useless to apply to Mr. Hall,” said
Alvin, “for nothing could induce him to
violate the confidence of another. But
Uncle Elk holds the master key and can
speak when he chooses.”</p>

<p>“Which the same is the rule with most
folks,” commented Mike.</p>

<p>“Now, see here,” put in Chester; “he
has shown a fondness for you——”</p>

<p>“Can ye name any one of me acquaintances
that hasn’t?” interrupted the wag.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span></p>

<p>“Why can’t you set to work and coax it
out of him?”</p>

<p>“Begorra! haven’t I tried more than
once. I’ve hinted and asked him straight
out until I’m in the fix of Phil Rafferty.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“Phil took a notion that he could butt
ivery other admirer of Bridget Mulrooney
off the track. He kipt at it till one day he
towld me he had a dim ’spicion that Bridget
and her big brother Tarn and her dad of
the same name, not forgitting Bridget her-silf,
weren’t as fond of him as they oughter
be. They had dropped purty plain hints
and the last time Phil called, Bridget
remarked sorter off-hand like, that she niver
wanted to see his ugly mug agin. Her
brother kicked him off the porch and flung
him over the fence and the owld gintleman
set their dog on him, which the same
nearly choked in trying to swaller the seat
of his pants. Phil said he was beginnin’
to ’spicion that the family took as a whole,
didn’t love him as they oughter. It’s the
same wid Uncle Elk and me. He’s riddy
to talk on anything excipt the raison them
two tramps was scared into taking a bath,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
and he won’t throw any light on that
p’int.”</p>

<p>“Then there is no use of either of us
trying.”</p>

<p>“I could hev towld ye that long ago.”</p>

<p>Once more it was Chester who showed
the most subtlety.</p>

<p>“Uncle Elk knows that Mike is doing all
he can to solve the puzzle; he knows
he’ll not stop trying till he learns the truth;
if Alvin and I keep him company, he will
understand that we have joined forces. It
will be as easy for him to baffle us three
when we are together as to defeat any one
of us. Therefore we ought to separate and
each push the hunt for himself.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve hit it!” exclaimed Mike, “and to
encourage ye in good works and to show ye
the honor ye oughter hev, I offers ye me
hand.”</p>

<p>He gravely extended his palm in the
gloom and it was warmly shaken.</p>

<p>Let a party of boys engage in some plot—and
the same is true of adults—and their
chief fear is that it will be discovered and
defeated by someone else more or less interested.
No precaution must be neglected.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
It was agreed by our friends that no one
of them should drop a word in the hearing
of others that could rouse curiosity, and
not to show by their manner that anything
unusual was on their minds.</p>

<p>One question considered was whether
Dr. Spellman should be taken into their
confidence. He had witnessed the panic of
the tramps and was as curious as the boys
to learn its cause. Alvin disposed of the
matter.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he can be of any help
and he doesn’t wish to leave his home too
long since the trouble he had with the
bums. Uncle Elk, for some reason, hates
the doctor; the two would be pretty sure
to meet if the doctor joined forces with
us, and the consequences would be bad.
Say what you please, Uncle Elk has a
queer twist in his brain, and I dread doing
anything that will excite him. Let us work
independently of every one else.”</p>

<p>“I’m wid ye,” assented Mike, and Chester
agreed.</p>

<p>This much decided upon, the particulars
of the plan remained to be arranged. Mike
proposed that he should saunter off alone
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
to the western end of the lake, near where
Alvin and Chester had gone in the canoe
during the day, and there with no companion
should set himself to learn what he
could. The others would take the opposite
course, which would lead them to the
home of Uncle Elk. They had no intention
of questioning the old man or even letting
him know what they had in mind, but
would employ their wits as opportunity
offered.</p>

<p>Nothing would have been more pleasing
than for Mike to use the canoe to reach
the western end of the lake, but he decided
that the safest course was for all three to
let the boats alone. The hermit would
doubtless be on the watch and would know
the errand of the lads.</p>

<p>“Do we need to have signals?” asked
Chester.</p>

<p>“What for?” inquired Alvin in turn.</p>

<p>“If one of us finds out something, he
will want to tell the others.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how the plan can work, for
we shall be so far apart that any call we
make will be heard by some of the Scouts
and may give the whole thing away.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
Whatever comes to light can wait till we meet
here after supper to-night.”</p>

<p>Mike, who had been thoughtful for a
minute or two, now spoke:</p>

<p>“We thought that being Mr. Hall’s lips
are closed, Uncle Elk is the only one that
can ixplain the queer actions of Biggs and
Hutt, but Uncle Elk isn’t the only one.”</p>

<p>“Who else can do so?”</p>

<p>“Biggs and Hutt.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Alvin, “but I don’t
believe they would show any more willingness
than Uncle Elk. Besides, after such a
fright as they got yesterday, they are probably
miles away at this minute and still
running.”</p>

<p>“Which doesn’t signify that they won’t
come back again. One would think they
would have taken the warning Dr. Spellman
gave them, but they didn’t. I believe
there is going to be more trouble with
those two scamps,” said Chester impressively.</p>

<p>“They’ve got to behave thimselves,”
added Mike with more feeling than he had
yet shown, “or I’ll git Mr. Hall to lead
the whole troop agin ’em.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span></p>

<p>“You know the Boy Scouts are opposed
to all violence.”</p>

<p>“And so’m I, excipt whin it’s yer dooty
to lambaste the ither chap, as whin he drops
a hint that he doesn’t think ye’re able to
doot. If Biggs and Hutt go to stealing or
stepping too hard on us, do ye ixpect we’re
going to grin and bear it?”</p>

<p>“Without answering that question,”
remarked Alvin, “let me suggest that if
any one of us happens to meet either or
both the hoboes, he does his best to get an
explanation from them. If you don’t succeed,
no harm will be done.”</p>

<p>“Good counsel,” commented Chester,
“but I don’t believe it will bring any
result.”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t neglect anything——”</p>

<p>“Whisht!” interrupted Mike, suddenly
laying his hand on the arm of this comrade.</p>

<p>All three became silent, and each distinctly
heard faint footfalls from a point
deeper in the wood.</p>

<p>“Some one has been listening,” whispered
Alvin, “but he couldn’t have heard anything.”</p>

<p>“And what if he did?” asked Chester;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
“we have no enemies in this part of the
world.”</p>

<p>Mike had started in the direction of the
suspicious sound. He did not take time
to soften the noise of his feet, and the
stranger thus warned hurried away. Evidently
he was a better woodman than his
pursuer, for he got over the ground faster.
Mike caught a glimpse of him in the star-gleam,
as he emerged on the beach and ran
off. A few minutes later the Irish youth
rejoined his friends.</p>

<p>“Do you know who it was?” asked Alvin.</p>

<p>“No; he didn’t spake nor look back.
I thought it best to return to ye.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t me shillaleh wid me, and I
was in too much danger of overhauling the
spalpeen.”</p>

<h1  id='chIX'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>CHAPTER IX — An Unwelcome Guest</h1>

<p>What may be called a minor mystery
was settled within a few minutes
after Alvin, Chester and Mike
came out of the wood and sat down for a
brief while on the porch. Most of the other
Boy Scouts had gone inside for the night,
though the murmur of voices showed the
majority were awake. The laugh of Scout
Master Hall was heard in response to some
jest, he being, as has been said, as much
of a youngster as the most youthful of the
troop.</p>

<p>A tall form loomed to view in the starlight,
and coming up the steps sat down
beside Mike with a greeting to all three.
He was recognized as Hoke Butler, a member
of the Stag Patrol.</p>

<p>“If you had run a little faster,” he
remarked with a loud laugh, “you surely
would have overtaken me, Mike.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span></p>

<p>“Why didn’t ye slack up and give me the
chance? Me legs ain’t as long as yours.”</p>

<p>“I did put on the brakes, but you turned
back.”</p>

<p>“I’d come to the belaif that if ye didn’t
want me company, I shouldn’t force mine
upon ye, so I quit. What were ye doing
in the wood behind us?”</p>

<p>“I was strolling behind the bungalow
when I heard voices and was stealing up
to learn who you were when you heard me,
and for the fun of it I darted off as if I was
scared half to death.”</p>

<p>“What did ye think of the views of mesilf
and Alvin and Chester as regards the nixt
Prisident?”</p>

<p>It was a shrewd question and brought the
desired answer.</p>

<p>“You talked so low I couldn’t catch a
word. Don’t you know that when Americans
talk politics they yell and generally
end in a fight?”</p>

<p>“We hadn’t got that fur; ye oughter
kept still a little while longer and ye might
hev took part in the shindy.”</p>

<p>So the eavesdropping amounted to nothing,
and so far no one besides the three
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
knew of the plan which they had formed.
A half hour later every Boy Scout in the
bungalow, including Jack Crandall, was
asleep.</p>

<p>The morning dawned clear, bright and
sunny. Jack would not permit any one to
stay with him, so his chair was wheeled
out on the front porch, where he became
absorbed in a work on ornithology, while
his friends broke into small groups and
wandered into the woods as fancy prompted
them. Scout Master Hall strolled off with
several members of his Patrol, the understanding
being that it was to be another
day in which each should do as he pleased.</p>

<p>Let twenty men, boys or girls be thrown
together in close companionship for weeks,
and likes and dislikes are sure to develop.
There may be nothing in the nature of
hatred, nor even an impatient word uttered.
Naturally affiliations spring up, while others
avoid one another, without suspecting there
is a cause for the mild repulsion.</p>

<p>Alvin Landon, Chester Haynes and Mike
Murphy were chums from the first and
were nearly always together. Mike was
popular with all because of his many fine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
qualities, aside from the marvelous treats
he occasionally gave in singing. One boy
formed so marked a fancy for him that
Mike did not like it because he could not
respond. This was Hoke Butler,—he who
had tried to play the eavesdropper the
night before. Something about him which
could not be defined repelled Mike, and
caused him to avoid or at least to try to
avoid his company. Perhaps it was Butler’s
habit of boisterous laughter when no
one else saw any cause for mirth, his disposition
to slap the knee or shoulder of the
boy nearest him, and his greediness at
meals. Be that as it may, Mike did not
like him, though too considerate to hurt
his feelings by showing his sentiments.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester were pleased, when
they supposed all the boys had left the
bungalow, to see Butler come up the steps,
take his place beside Mike and give his
knee a resounding slap.</p>

<p>“Hello, old chap! what are you going to
do to-day?” he asked in his boisterous
manner.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of doing as the ither byes
do,—stroll through the woods on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
lookout fur ostriches, kangaroos, monkeys or
anything that turns up.”</p>

<p>“Good! that’s me; I’ll go with you!”</p>

<p>“Who said ye would?” asked the disgusted
Mike, as Alvin winked at Chester.</p>

<p>“I did; didn’t you hear me?”</p>

<p>“But ye don’t know where I’m going.”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference; I’m with you
straight through.”</p>

<p>The chance was too good for Alvin and
Chester to let slip. The face of the former
brightened with hypocritical comradeship.</p>

<p>“Now isn’t that fine? Mike, you’re in
luck.”</p>

<p>“As Larry Bergen remarked whin he
found he had one finger lift after the pistol
busted in his hand.”</p>

<p>“How nice it will be to have Butler with
you the whole day!” Chester was mean
enough to add.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you three going together?” asked
the surprised interloper.</p>

<p>“We are particular as to our company,”
said Alvin; “Chester and I travel together
while Mike goes alone,—that is to say he
would do so if you had not come along in
time.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s me! I’m always glad to oblige.”</p>

<p>“Thim chaps,” said Mike, who was too
game to wince though none the less resolved
to baffle his chums, “are two babes in the
wood; it will be mighty kind of ye, Butler,
to go along and kaap an eye on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you see there are two of
them, and it will be the same with you and
me, which is the right way to divide up?
Just the idea, old chap!” And Butler
whacked the knee of Mike, who made a
grimace at the grinning Alvin and Chester.
“Tell you what, Mike, I took a shine to
you from the first; we must be pals.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it, Butler; we shall be glad
to loan you Mike whenever you want him.”</p>

<p>“That will be all the time,” roared the
interloper, “won’t it, Mike?”</p>

<p>“It begins to look that way,” was the
lugubrious response of the victim.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester rose to their feet, the
former remarking:</p>

<p>“We’ll see you at supper. Take good
care of Mike, who is so innocent that he
is sure to run into trouble unless you hold
him back. Mike, be sure to obey him just
as you do us.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span></p>

<p>And the two stepped from the porch and
set off in the direction of the cabin of Uncle
Elk, looking back in time to see their friend
shake his fist at them.</p>

<p>“It looks as if I was catched,” mused
Mike, “as the man said whin he stepped
into a bear trap, but I’ll aven up matters
wid thim before they’re much older.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it time we started?” asked Butler,
after the others had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Yis,” replied Mike standing up, “but
I can’t depart widout me buckthorn cane.
Bide here till I go into the house and git
the same.”</p>

<p>“I know where you left it leaning against
the wall; I’ll fetch it.”</p>

<p>And before he could be anticipated, Butler
darted through the open door and
brought out the heavy stick.</p>

<p>“Always ready to do what I can for you,
Mike; anything else?”</p>

<p>“Yis; I’ll be obleeged if ye’ll chase after
thim spalpeens and ask Alvin Landon to
send me that five dollars he borrered yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Of course; they haven’t got far and
I’ll be back in a jiffy.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t let him sneak out of it, but hang
on till he coughs up.”</p>

<p>“You bet I will!”</p>

<p>The obliging youth scooted off the porch
and after the couple who had disappeared
only a few moments before. Mike waited
only until he was beyond sight, when he
hurried in the opposite direction and dived
among the trees, as if he were a criminal
fleeing from an officer of the law.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the obliging Butler made
haste to do as requested. He was fleet of
foot, and had no trouble in overtaking
Alvin and Chester, who were walking at a
moderate pace, made still more moderate
by their merriment over the clever way in
which they had gotten the best of Mike.</p>

<p>“It isn’t often we can do it,” said Alvin,
“but we caught him fair that time. Hoke
will stick like a leech to him—hello! what’s
up now?” exclaimed the lad, as the sound
of footsteps caused both to look around.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” gasped Chester, “it can’t
be Mike has persuaded him to go with <span class='it'>us</span>!”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute!” called Butler.</p>

<p>The two halted and Alvin asked reproachfully:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span></p>

<p>“Why have you deserted Mike, when he
wants you so badly?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t deserted him; he and I are
going to have a day’s ramble together.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“He asked me to run after you and get
the five dollars he loaned you yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Chest, have you got any money with
you?” asked the astonished Alvin; “I have
only a Canadian quarter.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t even that. I did the same as
you, and left all my funds in the house.”</p>

<p>“You see what Mike is up to; it’s a
trick of his to get rid of this fellow.”</p>

<p>Addressing the latter, Alvin added:</p>

<p>“That’s what I call a low down piece of
business; why didn’t he ask us when we
were at the house?”</p>

<p>“I reckon he didn’t think of it; hurry
up, please; I don’t want to keep him
waiting.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t help it, for we haven’t
a dollar between us. Hurry back to him
and say for us that we shall settle with
him to-night when you and he come back.”</p>

<p>“Honest now, is that the best you can
do?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span></p>

<p>“It certainly is; if you don’t hurry Mike
will grow tired of waiting for you.”</p>

<p>Alarmed at the probability, Butler dashed
away like a deer, while Alvin and Chester
hurried in the other direction with a view
of being out of reach should the young man
return.</p>

<p>But Hoke did not come back. He had
set his heart on rejoining his chosen friend
and bent his energies to that end.</p>

<p>After walking briskly for a half mile,
Alvin and Chester slowed down and took
matters more easily. They were so deep
in the woods that they could see nothing
of the lake, but they had become familiar
with the route and were in no fear of going
astray. When quite near the cabin of
Uncle Elk, they saw three other Boy Scouts
wandering among the trees, one of them
with note book in hand. He was making
entries and all were so engaged in the
pleasant task that it was easy for Alvin and
Chester to avoid being seen as they changed
their course. Soon after they came in sight
of the log structure where their old friend
made his home. Halting while still among
the trees, their position gave them a view
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
of the front of the building and the upper
part of the path which wound its way down
to the lake. The latch-string was hanging
outside the door with everything as still
and motionless as the tomb.</p>

<p>“Well, now that we have arrived,”
remarked Alvin in an undertone, “what are
we going to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that anything is to be gained
by calling upon Uncle Elk, but, if he catches
sight of us, we shall have to drop in on him.
He is sure to treat us well.”</p>

<p>“Hello! we are not the only ones,” said
Chester, as he and his chum stepped back
behind the trunk of a large white oak.</p>

<p>The heads and shoulders of two men came
into sight as they walked slowly up the
path from the landing which they had evidently
reached in a boat. A few paces
brought them into plain sight, one directly
behind the other and approaching the door
of the cabin.</p>

<p>The first thought of the boys was that
they were the tramps who had been making
nuisances of themselves in the neighborhood
for the last few days, but a second
look made it clear they were not, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
nothing in their appearance suggested the wandering
vagrant. The striking fact about
them was they were so similar in looks that
it was evident they were twin brothers.
The similarity extended to their clothing.
They wore straw hats set well back on their
heads, coarse shirts without tie or waistcoat,
and dark trousers whose bottoms
were tucked into a pair of boots that did
not quite reach their knees. The two were
of sandy complexion and each had a tuft
of yellow whiskers on his chin, which was
of the retreating order.</p>

<p>“They must be the men Mike heard
chuckling together last night, though he did
not see them,” was the conclusion of Chester,
and his companion agreed with him.</p>

<p>“And they seem as much pleased as
ever.”</p>

<p>Both wore a broad grin, and the one in
front, half turning his head, said something
which caused the other to laugh out loud.</p>

<p>Before the visitors reached the door, it
was drawn inward by Uncle Elk, who
appeared, staff in hand, as if about to start
on a tramp through the woods. At sight
of the young men, he paused and called:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Asa and Bige; I
was about to hunt you up, but this saves
me the trouble; come in.”</p>

<p>He shook the hand of each in turn and
the three passed from sight, the host closing
the door behind them.</p>

<p>“And now what shall we do?” asked the
perplexed Alvin; “we have seen two strangers
go into the cabin and they are talking
together, but we can’t hear a word that is
said nor learn a thing.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen; let’s follow
them, as we have the right to do so long
as the latchstring hangs outside.”</p>

<p>This proposal would have been carried
out had not the necessity been removed by
the persons in whom they were interested.
The door unexpectedly opened and the trio
came out, Uncle Elk leading, staff in hand,
and the others following in Indian file.
They passed down the path toward the
lake and were soon shut from sight by the
intervening trees and undergrowth.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester were sure their presence
had not been noted, and they held
back until safe against being seen. Then
they moved stealthily down the trail to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
point where they had a clear view of the
smooth sheet of water. A hundred yards
away, a small canoe was gliding at moderate
speed toward the other side, its course such
that it would reach shore—unless the
direction was changed—some distance west
of Dr. Spellman’s home. In the boat were
seated Uncle Elk and the couple whom he
had addressed as Asa and Bige, one of
them swinging the paddle with the grace of
a professional.</p>

<p>Keeping out of sight, the two youths
watched the course of the boat, which
gradually veered to the left.</p>

<p>“Uncle Elk has left his own canoe on the
shore and we can use it if we wish to follow
them,” said Alvin.</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything would be more
foolish. In fact, Al, it strikes me that so
far our part of the business is a failure.
Those folks are going into the territory of
Mike and I hope he will have better success
than we. He can’t have less.”</p>

<p>All the lads could do for the present was
to watch and wait. The canoe grew smaller
as it receded, and finally disappeared under
the overhanging limbs and vegetation at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
spot which the boys agreed was either
where Mike Murphy had heard Asa and
Bige laughing the night before, or very near
the spot. And, admitting that such was
the fact, what did it all amount to?</p>

<h1  id='chX'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>CHAPTER X — A Sudden Separation</h1>

<p>When Mike Murphy hurried off
the opposite end of the porch of
the bungalow, his single purpose
was to rid himself of Hoke Butler, who had
set his heart upon keeping him company
for the day. It was a happy thought thus
to send the youth to collect an imaginary
debt from Alvin Landon, and it would
seem could scarcely fail of accomplishing
the end in view.</p>

<p>“The spalpeen can thravel a good deal
faster then mesilf, owing to the lingth of
his legs, but I’ve got too good a start for
him to find me among the traas.”</p>

<p>Mike still walked fast, often glancing
behind and more and more relieved that he
failed to gain sight of a living person, or
rather of him whom he dreaded to see.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mike, where are you?”</p>

<p>The youth appealed to almost leaped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
from the ground, for the familiar voice
sounded much too near for comfort.</p>

<p>“I’m here just now,” muttered Mike,
“but I don’t intind to stay. Worrah,
worrah, is there no way of shaking ye
loose?”</p>

<p>The shout was repeated twice and then
ceased. It looked as if Hoke believed he
was too far separated from his friend to
reach him by calling, though he was not
likely to give up the search for some time
to come. Mike changed his course and in
doing so came near losing himself. It was
impossible in the circumstances to go far
astray, but he was likely to waste a good
deal of time.</p>

<p>Coming to a halt he took his bearings.
He knew he was well to the westward of
the bungalow and not far from the lake.
He was sure also, after noting the position
of the sun, of the course he should follow
to reach the body of water. His plan was
to keep along shore until he came to the
western end of the lake, around which he
would make his way if necessary, returning
by the northern bank which would take
him past the home of Dr. Spellman. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
conviction, however, was strong with the
young man that he would not be called
upon to travel that far before gaining the
knowledge which was drawing him onward
as the steel draws the magnet.</p>

<p>When he had traveled far enough to
bring him to the lake and still failed to
catch the gleam of its surface, he halted
once more and stared around.</p>

<p>“If I’m lost agin I’ll hire some of the
byes to lead me about by the hand, fur I
ain’t fit to travel alone—hello! there’s one
of ’em, that I’ll question without letting
him know I’m a stray lamb.”</p>

<p>He had a glimpse of a moving body almost
directly ahead, and knowing it was one of
the scouts he called:</p>

<p>“I wish to remark, me friend, that it’s
a foine day; if ye agraa wid me I shall be
plaised to have ye signerfy the same.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mike, I’m so glad to see you
again; you ain’t mad because I got lost?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not a bit, as Jim O’Toole said whin
the sheriff apologized for shooting him on
the wing.”</p>

<p>And Mike extended his hand to Hoke
Butler as he came grinningly forward.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span></p>

<p>“How was it ye missed me?” asked Mike
innocently.</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I can tell; I hurried
back after talking to Alvin and ought to
have found you, but somehow or other
I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t ye holler?”</p>

<p>“I nearly split my throat calling to you.”</p>

<p>“Strange! I wonder if I’m getting deaf.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! I hope not; don’t say that
or you’ll worry me awfully.”</p>

<p>“Did Alvin hand ye the five dollars?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. Say, Mike, they must
be blamed poor, for they had only a Canadian
quarter between them. I don’t think
they amount to much.”</p>

<p>Mike couldn’t stand this slur upon his
chums.</p>

<p>“Let me tell ye something that will
make ye open yer eyes. Alvin Landon’s
father is one of the richest men in New
York, and Chester’s is almost as wealthy.
They are worth millions upon millions of
dollars, and the byes have all the money
they want, but they are not such fules as
you and me and don’t throw it away,
though they give a good deal of it to poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
folks. So ye may rist aisy on that score,
friend Hoke.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I never suspected that. They
don’t put on any more airs than the poorest
of the Boy Scouts.”</p>

<p>“Which the same shows their sinse;
they’ve always been that way and always
will be. But this isn’t tending to bus’ness.
Do ye wish to keep company wid
me till night?”</p>

<p>“You bet! I’m going to stick to you
like a burr; I hope you haven’t any hard
feelings on account of my losing you for a
little while. I really didn’t mean it.”</p>

<p>“It’s mesilf that has no hard feelings,
but I was thinking that if we don’t get
back to the clubhouse till night ye will be
obliged to lose your dinner.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that much, but I’ll stand
it for your sake. I’ll even things up at
the supper table. A Boy Scout should
learn to suffer when it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>“I’ve found out the same,” replied Mike
with a significance which his companion
did not catch; “I hope we shan’t starve
to death.”</p>

<p>“No danger of that,” remarked Hoke,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
not absolutely certain that some such
calamity did not threaten them.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy like a philosopher made up
his mind to accept the inevitable. It
seemed to be decreed by fate that he should
have this young man as a companion
throughout at least this day, so what was
the use of kicking against it? Besides, it
was not impossible that where there was so
much eagerness on the part of Hoke to
help, he might be able to do so in the strange
task Mike had laid out for himself.</p>

<p>One pleasing fact about the intruder was
that he never lost his way. He pointed out
the direction in which the lake lay and Mike
took care not to let him know he himself
had believed that an altogether different
course led to it. Pausing on the shore they
looked out upon one of the most beautiful
and romantic bodies of water to be found
in a region which abounds with them.
Both saw the canoe laden deeply with three
men which was heading for a point to the
westward of Dr. Spellman’s home. The
boys studied it closely, but the distance
was too great to identify the old man, and
his companions were strangers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span></p>

<p>Mike had told young Butler nothing of
his experience of the day before, nor did
he do so now. Whatever Hoke was able
to do in the way of aid he could accomplish
as well while ignorant as if he knew everything.</p>

<p>“Would it be too far, Hoke, for ye to
walk wid me round the end of the lake to
the spot where the canoe wint from sight?”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty good walk, Mike, but it’s
nothing so long as I am with <span class='it'>you</span>. I can’t
think of anything I wouldn’t do to please
you.”</p>

<p>“I could, but I’ll not mintion it,”
grinned Mike as they resumed their course
with Hoke in the lead.</p>

<p>The forenoon was half gone when they
came to the western end of the lake and
changed their course so as to follow the
curvature that would take them to the
northern shore. All the time they were
in sight of the water, which they examined
at intervals in quest of other boats. While
the home of Dr. Spellman, as we remember,
was invisible from the lake, it was easy
to locate it by the thin wisp of smoke
which filtered through the tree-tops. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
same could have been said of Uncle Elk’s
cabin had there been any fire burning.</p>

<p>“I am thinking, Mike,” remarked Hoke
some time later, “that if you intend to
go clean round the lake we haven’t any time
to throw away.”</p>

<p>“We kin take all day and the night,
should the same be nicissary, but there’s
no call to hurry and if ye find yersilf
growing weary, ye have me permission to
turn back whin the notion takes ye.”</p>

<p>“We have gone so far that I don’t see
much choice in taking either direction.
I say, Mike, isn’t that something queer
ahead of us?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know where ye could be
without something qua’ar being ahead of
ye,—begora! I belave ye are right,” added
Mike in surprise. An object loomed up
which he had not seen before nor had he
heard any one speak of it, though he and
others had been in the neighborhood more
than once.</p>

<p>At a point where the undergrowth was
plentiful and less than a hundred yards
back from the shore, were the ruins of what
probably had once been a fisherman or
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
hunter’s cabin. Long before the present
time, some party had erected these rude
quarters as a refuge during cold or stormy
weather only to abandon them for more
inviting protection. The ruins were simply
four walls of logs hardly a dozen feet
square and less than half as high. If there
had once been a roof, it had disappeared
long since. No door was visible from where
the boys stood.</p>

<p>“It reminds me of the Castle of Donleigh,
which I niver obsarved,” remarked
Mike after they had stood for some minutes.</p>

<p>“I think some one started to put up a
cabin such as Uncle Elk did, but changed
his mind before he built a roof. Maybe
it was Uncle Elk himself.”</p>

<p>“Aither him or somebody ilse; let’s look
further.”</p>

<p>Instead of going nearer, the two slowly
circled the ruins, keeping a little way from
them. When the circuit was completed
the surprising fact became known that nothing
in the nature of a door had been made
by those who laid the logs. Manifestly the
structure had been abandoned before it was
half finished.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s easy to raise yourself high enough
to look inside,” suddenly remarked Hoke;
“I’m going to have a peep. Wait here till
I come back.”</p>

<p>He ran to the side of the pile, with Mike
slowly following. The latter gripped his
shillaleh firmly, but was moving so slowly
that he had not passed a third of the distance
when Hoke inserted the toe of one
foot in a lower crevice, sprang lightly upward
and seized the topmost log with both
hands. This raised his head above the
barrier, and in the same minute Mike saw
a hand thrust forward from the inside,
grasp the collar of his companion’s coat
and violently yank him out of sight.</p>

<h1  id='chXI'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>CHAPTER XI — An Unsatisfactory Interview</h1>

<p>Mike Murphy was never more
astounded in his life.</p>

<p>“He oughter said good-bye before
he took that dive,” exclaimed the youth,
who was not the one to stand idle when a
companion, even one whom he did not
specially fancy, was in danger. Mike’s
chivalry was roused, and with no thought
of the consequences to himself, he ran to
the help of the other lad. His shillaleh
was firmly grasped in his left hand, and held
ready for instant use, for nothing seemed
more probable than that the weapon would
be quickly needed.</p>

<p>Mike was sure that if he imitated Hoke,
he would be seized in the same way. He
therefore hurried lightly to the opposite
side of the pile, where as silently as he could,
he thrust the toe of his shoe into the crevice
between the lower logs, gave a spring,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
caught hold of the upper tier, and drew
himself upward.</p>

<p>Buzby Biggs, one of the tramps whom
we have met, was sitting on the ground
inside the crude cabin and punching his
stubby forefinger into the bowl of his corncob
pipe, with a view of tamping the tobacco
and making it ready to light, when the
sound of voices outside caused him to suspend
operations. He rose to his feet,
intending to peep through a small opening
of which he knew when he heard the
scratching made by Hoke’s shoes as he
climbed the low wall. Angered by the
intrusion upon his privacy, he waited until
the head of the lad rose to view, when he
proceeded to act as has been described.</p>

<p>Hoke was too startled to make any outcry
or resistance. The violence of his
debut caused him to sprawl forward on his
hands and knees and his hat fell off. He
instinctively picked it up and replaced it
on his head.</p>

<p>“What do yer mean by butting into a
gentleman’s private residence without ringing
the bell or sending in your card?”
demanded Biggs, who finding himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
confronted by only one lad, could feel no misgiving
as to his own safety.</p>

<p>“Gee! I didn’t know <span class='it'>you</span> were here,”
replied Hoke, alarmed over the strange
situation in which he was caught.</p>

<p>“That don’t make no difference,” replied
the hobo, who seemed to be trying to work
himself into a passion; “yer showed yer
ain’t used to perlite sassiety and I allers
makes a feller pay for the privilege of coming
into the castle of the Duke de Sassy.”</p>

<p>Poor Hoke was scared almost out of his
wits. He began fumbling in his pockets.</p>

<p>“How much is the charge? I haven’t
got more’n two or three dollars with me.”</p>

<p>“In that case, it will take all and that
ere watch which I persoom is tied to t’other
end of the chain dangling in front.”</p>

<p>“Why that would be robbery!” exclaimed
the lad, indignant at the impending outrage.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t call it that, younker; rayther
it’s the toll yer hef to pay for crossin’ this
bridge. So yer may as well shell out first
as last.”</p>

<p>As Hoke stood, his back was against the
side of the wooden wall over which he had
just tumbled, with the tramp scowling
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
and malignant, facing him. Thus, as will
be noted, Biggs was on the side of the
structure up which Mike Murphy had
climbed so silently that no one heard him.
Hoke in fact began to rally from his panic
and was on the point of shouting for help
when he saw the end of Mike’s buckthorn
cane, gripped in his left hand, slide up into
view, instantly followed by the hat and red,
freckled countenance of the Irish youth,
who remained motionless for a moment,
while he peered at the curious picture
below him.</p>

<p>Before Hoke could utter the glad words
on his tongue, Mike shook his head as a
warning for him to hold his peace. The
other caught on and did not look directly
at his friend, but straight into the face of
the tousled scamp. Mike was so clearly
in his field of vision that Hoke saw every
movement and even the expression of the
face which was never more welcome.</p>

<p>The next instant one knee of Mike rested
on the topmost log, then the foot slid over
and he perched firmly on the top with his
shillaleh transferred to his right hand.</p>

<p>The sight of his friend heartened Hoke.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span></p>

<p>“You can’t have my watch and chain,
and I sha’n’t give you a penny! You
have no more right here than I, and you
daresen’t lay a hand on me.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? what’s that?” demanded
the other, taking a step forward and thrusting
out his ugly visage; “I guess it’s time
I teached you something.”</p>

<p>“Aisy there, Misther Biggs; I think it’s
mesilf will hev something to say ’bout
this.”</p>

<p>The hobo whirled about and confronted
the Irish lad, seated on the top of the wall
and grasping his heavy cane.</p>

<p>“Where did <span class='it'>yer</span> come from?” growled the
tramp, who ought not to have been frightened
by the presence of two sturdy youths.</p>

<p>Mike made the Boy Scout salute.</p>

<p>“From Tipperary, county of Tipperary,
Ireland. Would ye be kind enough to
exchange cards wid me?” and he pretended
to search in his pocket for that which he
never carried. “Clarence, me noble friend,”
added Mike, addressing Hoke Butler, “ye
may as well withdraw from this palatial
residence, as me friends used to say when
laving our shanty at home.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span></p>

<p>Hoke was instant to seize the opportunity
thus presented. He clambered up
the logs with the vivacity of a monkey,
scooted over the wall, dropped to the ground
and then made off at the highest bent of
his speed. He did not seem to think he
was deserting a friend in extremity and after
that friend had been quick to rush to his
relief.</p>

<p>A glance behind told Mike the truth,
whereat he was displeased, though he did
not show it by his manner. It was not so
bad, however, as at first appeared. Hoke
had run only a little way when the cowardice
of what he was doing halted him as
abruptly as he had started.</p>

<p>And then it was that an inspiration seized
him. Questioning the wisdom of him and
Mike bearding, as may be said, the lion in
his den, Hoke made a pretence that help
was near. He shouted at the top of his
voice:</p>

<p>“Dr. Spellman! Here we are! Why
don’t you hurry up?”</p>

<p>It was pure good fortune that led Hoke
thus to appeal to the only person whom the
hobo held in dread, for the youth knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
nothing of what had occurred previously.
He was doubtful about calling upon Uncle
Elk, and another Boy Scout did not seem
a formidable enough reinforcement. Scout
Master Hall would have served, but Hoke
did not think of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Buzby Biggs heard the shouted
words and could not forget that the physician
was the owner of firearms and did not
seem reluctant to use them. Although the
two vagrants had been spared, it was doubtful
whether mercy would be shown them
again. Despite his attempt to bluff, the
tramp could not repress a tremor in his
voice.</p>

<p>“What’s he calling that ’ere doctor fur?”</p>

<p>“I think he remarked a remark about
telling him to hurry up. Av coorse ye will
be glad to meet the docther agin.”</p>

<p>“Not by a blamed sight; him and me
don’t speak as we pass by.”</p>

<p>“He prefers to spake wid his revolver,
I belave.”</p>

<p>Mike had been instant to read the trick
of Hoke, and he helped all he could. Biggs
was in such a fright he could not hide it.
The last person in the world whom he wished
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
to meet was the medical man. He turned
to imitate the action of Hoke Butler.</p>

<p>“Howld on! None of that!” commanded
Mike in such a peremptory voice that Biggs
with hands on the logs in front and one
foot raised, checked himself and looked
around.</p>

<p>“What do yer want?” he growled;
“hain’t I a right to leave my home when
I please?”</p>

<p>“Which is what Jimmy Jones said when
the sheriff stopped him as he was breaking-jail.
You don’t want to bump up agin the
docther whin he has that pill box in his
hand. See here, Biggs, I’ll let you go on
one condition.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” growled the other.</p>

<p>“Yesterday when ye and t’other scamp
was paddling off in the canoe ye stole, ye
made a sudden dive overboord and swum
fur shore; by yer manner I knowed ye
wouldn’t run the risk of taking a bath if
ye hadn’t been scared out of what little
wits ye had.”</p>

<p>“It would have been the same with yer,
if yer’d seen what we did.”</p>

<p>“If ye’ll tell me what ye obsarved, ye
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
may lave whin you choose and I’ll give ye
me pledge that Docther Spellman won’t
harm ye.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll tell yer as soon as I git
outside this place.”</p>

<p>“You can’t wait till then; ye must give
me the sacret while ye are standing there.
If ye don’t I won’t interfare wid the docther
working his will.”</p>

<p>An expression of dread passed over the
repulsive face and the man actually shivered.</p>

<p>“Wai, whin me and Saxy was going along
in the canoe we borrered wid me paddling, I
happened to look down into the clear water
and my eyes rested upon—<span class='it'>the devil himself</span>!”</p>

<p>Mike Murphy was taken aback for the
moment by this amazing reply. His first
thought was that the hobo was trifling with
him, but, if so, his acting could not have
been better. Astounding as was his declaration
the man believed his own words
which conveyed no meaning to the youth.</p>

<p>“Worra now, don’t ye understand it?”</p>

<p>“No; do yer?”</p>

<p>“That clear water sarves like a looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
glass. Whin ye looked down ye obsarved
yer own image and I don’t wonder ye took
it for owld Nick.”</p>

<p>“But Saxy seed the same as I did,”
replied the man, impressed by the not complimentary
explanation of the lad who was
perched on top of the log wall.</p>

<p>“It was his picter that he saan and aich
of ye luks more like t’other than he does
like himsilf.”</p>

<p>Biggs shook his head. This wouldn’t
do.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t like a man at all.”</p>

<p>“What did it luk like?”</p>

<p>Mike was excited. He felt he was on
the eve of clearing up the mystery which
had baffled him and others, though not
Uncle Elk, who would say nothing.</p>

<p>Instead of giving an intelligent reply to
the question for a further bill of particulars,
the tramp shuddered as before. There
was a whine in his voice when he spoke:</p>

<p>“Didn’t I answer yer as I agreed? What
are yer kicking about?”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve got to do more than that afore I
asks the docther not to p’int his gun this
way and pull the trigger.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span></p>

<p>“Have yer ever seed the devil?”</p>

<p>“Not afore I looked upon yersilf.”</p>

<p>“Then how do yer expict me to describe
him? He was there right under the canoe
and almost close enough to grab us.”</p>

<p>“Did he hev horns and a spiked tail?”</p>

<p>Mike had heard the sound of footsteps
behind him on the leaves. Some one was
approaching and he was sure it was Hoke
Butler coming back to his help.</p>

<p>Biggs made no reply to the frivolous
question of the youth seated above him.
The taint of superstition in his nature
resented such treatment of a theme which
had nothing but terror to him. Mike,
certain that he commanded the situation
and was about to learn that which he
yearned to know, felt that he need not haste.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll hev to do better than that, Signor
Biggs, but as ye saam to prefer that the
docther should take ye in hand I’ll turn
ye over to him.”</p>

<p>And Mike turned to wink at Hoke Butler,
but to his dismay, discovered in the
same moment that his friend was not in
sight, and the one who had come up behind
him was Saxy Hutt, the other tramp.</p>

<h1  id='chXII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>CHAPTER XII — Groping After the Truth</h1>

<p>Mike Murphy’s ready wit did
not desert him at the moment
when, as may be said, he discovered
he was caught between two fires.
One of the tramps was standing on the
ground in front or below him, while the
second was approaching from the rear or
only a few paces farther off. And Hoke
Butler, who should have been instant to
rush to the help of his friend, was nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p>“I say, docther, why don’t ye hurry
up?” shouted Mike, as if calling over the
head of the grinning hobo, whose eyes
were fixed upon him with a dangerous
expression, as if he had decided to even
up matters for previous humiliations.</p>

<p>The peremptory manner of the lad produced
its effect, and Saxy Hutt paused and
looked up at him. A scratching, rattling
noise caused Mike to turn his head. Biggs
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
was furiously climbing the logs on the other
side. Grasping the topmost one, he dived
over, sprawling upon his hands and knees,
instantly leaping to his feet, and making
off at the speed he had shown in his former
flight. He evidently believed in the near
approach of the man whom he dreaded.</p>

<p>Mike swung around on his perch, so that
his feet hung outside, and gazed calmly
down upon the repulsive face.</p>

<p>“The top of the morning to ye, Saxy,”
greeted the lad; “I hope ye are well.”</p>

<p>“Huh! yer needn’t try that bluff on us,”
growled the scamp; “it won’t work; thar
ain’t no doctor round these parts and I
wouldn’t care a hang if there was. I
owe you one, younker, and I’m going to
take it out of your hide.”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Mike was pleased to
hear this declaration. Biggs, whom he
regarded as the worst of the couple, had
taken himself off and need not be considered
further, so that it was one against
one, and the youngster had a firm grip on
his shillaleh. With a fair field and no
favor Mike was content to let the best
man win.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span></p>

<p>The tramp came nearer, clenched his
fists and glared upward at the youth.</p>

<p>“Come down out of that and I’ll wring
your neck fur yer.”</p>

<p>“Step a little closer, so I can reach ye
wid a single jump.”</p>

<p>Mike was actually gathering his muscles
for a leap that would have brought on a
fight as vicious as that of two wildcats,
when the tense stillness was broken by the
words:</p>

<p>“Right this way, doctor; you’ll find them
both here, your shots can’t miss.”</p>

<p>Now the peculiarity of this remark was
that although plainly heard, it sounded as
if the speaker meant that only the man
at his side should catch his words. And
it was at this juncture that Hoke Butler
did a thing so clever that it won the everlasting
admiration of Mike Murphy. The
former dropped his voice several notes, so
that one unacquainted with the facts,
would have been certain it was another
who was speaking.</p>

<p>“Show me a sight of them—just for a
minute: that’s all I ask!”</p>

<p>Mike heard and understood. Saxy heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
and misunderstood,—that is he believed it
was the physician who was looking for him
with a loaded weapon in hand. He muttered
an exclamation which it will never
do to print, plunged around the log structure,
and disappeared with a speed that
must have quickly overhauled the other
tramp.</p>

<p>Mike dropped lightly to the ground and
confronted the chuckling Hoke.</p>

<p>“Worra! but ye did that well. Where
is the docther?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? I suppose he’s
at his home.”</p>

<p>“What put it into yer head to make
believe he was near us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know except he was the first
person I thought of.”</p>

<p>“Ye couldn’t have done better if ye had
took a month. I don’t understand why
thim tramps hang round so much whin
they know what they’re likely to git from
Dr. Spellman.”</p>

<p>Mike now told Hoke of the surprising
incidents of the preceding day, when the
hobos received the scare of their lives.</p>

<p>“This one who calls himsilf Biggs told
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
me that whin he looked over the side of
the canoe, he found himsilf face to face
wid the devil.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he did, Mike?”</p>

<p>“I have me doubts, as Jerry Jinks said
whin Father MacMahon declared he was an
honest man. Anyhow I haven’t larned
what I wanted to know, and we’ve got to
look farther.”</p>

<p>It was decided to pass around the western
end of the lake, circling back in the direction
of Dr. Spellman’s home, past the cabin
of Uncle Elk and go on to the bungalow.
This was likely to take most of the day,
even if they were not delayed by some unexpected
occurrence. Moreover, this course
would take them by the spot where Mike
had heard voices the night before, and where
the hermit darted out from under the overhanging
vegetation on his return, going
so near the startled Mike that the two saw
each other. The old man and his visitors
appeared to have gone thither, and it would
seem that something ought to be doing.</p>

<p>“Would you like to know what <span class='it'>my</span> idea
is?” asked Hoke, when they resumed their
tramping on the line that has been indicated.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m that anxious to know that I won’t
take anither step till ye ixplains the same.”</p>

<p>And Mike, who was a few paces in advance,
halted abruptly, wheeled about and
faced his companion, who grinningly responded:</p>

<p>“It is that we keep going till we reach
Dr. Spellman’s house and accept his invitation
to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we don’t get the invitation,”
suggested Mike.</p>

<p>“I should like to see him avoid giving it,
even if the dinner hour is past, which it is
likely to be before we can reach his place.”</p>

<p>Mike’s rugged health and sturdy strength
gave him as keen an appetite as that of his
companion, and a good meal would be as
welcome to him-as to Hoke. Moreover,
the situation was such that they could
hardly hope to reach the clubhouse before
nightfall. He therefore inclined to the
plan of calling at the house where they
were sure of welcome, but it will be borne
in mind that in order to do this, they would
have to give over or at least postpone the
investigation they had intended to make
at the point where Mike had heard voices
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
and seen Uncle Elk the night before,
since this lay to the westward of the physician’s
camp.</p>

<p>Accordingly the youths turned deeper
into the wood, going well beyond sight of
the lake, intending to approach their destination
by a circuitous course. Not wishing
to run against Uncle Elk and the strangers,
they made sure of not doing so.</p>

<p>You need not be reminded that one of
the easiest things in the world is to lose
your way in a wilderness. Mike Murphy
seemed peculiarly subject to this misfortune,
as has been shown in the previous
pages. He kept in the lead, as he had done
from the first, his friend quietly following
and paying no attention to his own footsteps.
By and by it struck Hoke that it
was time they reached the doctor’s dwelling.
He looked searchingly ahead and around,
but saw nothing except the tall, column-like
trunks, with considerable undergrowth here
and there. Naught that resembled the
most primitive dwelling was in sight, nor
was there a sign of any person having
passed that way.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Mike!” he called abruptly to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
his friend, and the latter halted and looked
back.</p>

<p>“I’m doing that, and what is it ye want
of me?”</p>

<p>“Where are we?” asked the puzzled
fellow.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking we’re here, as I remarked
whin I fell off the house. What do <span class='it'>ye</span>
think?”</p>

<p>“Of course we are somewhere near Gosling
Lake, but I believe we have strayed
off and are lost.”</p>

<p>“It’s mesilf that don’t see how that can
be, though I can beat any gentleman that
walks on two legs in going the wrong way.
The first time I started to go upstairs, I
opened the cellar dure and bumped all the
way to the bottom, and when I was faaling
me way fur the cellar dure, I tumbled out
the parlor windy. Then mither sent me
on an errand to Widow Mulligan’s and
instead of stepping onto the porch, I put
my fut over the well curb and didn’t find
out the difference till I hit the bottom of
the well. So you see, Hoke, that that
wakeness is my strongest p’int.”</p>

<p>“Where do you think the lake lies?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not as far gone as that; head that
way and you’ll walk straight onto the
same.” Mike pointed his shillaleh to the
left, whereupon his friend laughed.</p>

<p>“Just what I expected; you’re away off.”</p>

<p>“What do <span class='it'>ye</span> make it,—since you saam
to think you can make no mistake?”</p>

<p>“I never lose my bearings,—you can
depend on me. <span class='it'>That</span> direction leads to
the lake.”</p>

<p>The joke of it was that Hoke instead of
deviating more or less from the course
pointed out by Mike, chose one that was
the opposite.</p>

<p>“Are ye in airnest?” asked Mike.</p>

<p>“Never more so.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to larn that, for I don’t like
such jokes, as Jim O’Hara said whin the
policeman broke his club over his head.
Ye are wrong.”</p>

<p>“I’m positive I am not.”</p>

<p>“And I’m positive ye are,—and the only
way to sittle the question according to
common sinse is to toss up. What do ye
say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how that can settle any
question; but have it your own way.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span></p>

<p>Mike took a Lincoln penny from his
pocket and balanced it in his hand.</p>

<p>“If it comes down a hid, ye take my
course; if a tail, yours.”</p>

<p>Hoke nodded to signify he agreed, and
the other flipped the coin aloft, each
watching as it turned over rapidly and fell
upon the leaves between them, but lo! it
rested on its edge, being supported vertically
against a pine cone. In other words
it was neither a head nor tail, but a “cock.”</p>

<p>Usage requires that in such a case a new
toss must be made, but when Mike picked
up the penny he shoved it into his pocket
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“The maaning of that,” he explained,
“is that we are both wrong.”</p>

<p>“How then shall we find the true course?”</p>

<p>“Make a guess, as I used to do in answering
the taycher’s questions—Hist!”</p>

<p>Before the experiment could be made,
they were startled by hearing the report
of a gun or a pistol from some point not
far off, though the direction was different
from either that had been indicated.</p>

<p>As they listened, a second, third and
fourth report rang through the forest arches,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
followed quickly by two more, and all was
still.</p>

<p>There might be several explanations of
the incident, but it was idle to spend time
in guessing, when it was easy to learn the
truth. Mike, followed by his friend, walked
rapidly toward the point whence the reports
had come, and a few minutes later everything
was clear.</p>

<p>Dr. Spellman was standing in a space
free from undergrowth and practising with
his revolver. With his knife he had
gashed the bark off a sapling several feet
above the ground, so as to show a white
spot the size of a dollar. Standing a dozen
or more paces distant, he aimed carefully
and put the whole six bullets within a
spot not more than two inches in diameter,
three of them being bull’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do better mesilf!” exclaimed
Mike, when he understood the feat.</p>

<p>“You can’t tell till you try; I am not sure
you are not an expert.”</p>

<p>“Nor am I, though I have me doubts.”</p>

<p>Having reloaded the weapon the doctor
handed it to Mike, who slowly raised his
arm to a level, shut one eye, and squinted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
some seconds over the short barrel, while
the doctor and Hoke, standing a foot or
two to the rear, kept their eyes upon the
little white spot in the distance. Then a
sharp crack sounded and the marksman
lowered the pistol.</p>

<p>“Did ye obsarve where me shot landed?”
he asked of his friends.</p>

<p>“I think it nipped the leaves somewhere
overhead,” replied Hoke.</p>

<p>“I scorn to notice yer slur: what do
ye say, docther?”</p>

<p>The physician said nothing, but walked
to the sapling, the others trailing after
him. Taking out his pocket knife, he
began digging with the blade into the soft
wood. From the very center of the white
spot, he gouged out a pellet of lead, and
held it out to Mike.</p>

<p>“That is yours; you made a perfect
bull’s eye.”</p>

<p>“Av course; did ye doubt I would do the
same?”</p>

<p>“Hooh! all chance! you can’t do it again,”
called Hoke, uttering a truth that was as
apparent to Mike as to the others.</p>

<p>“It’s yer turn,” replied the hero of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
exploit; “do ye make the attempt yersilf;
if ye can equal me, then I’ll take me turn
again.”</p>

<h1  id='chXIII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>CHAPTER XIII — The Committee of Investigation</h1>

<p>Lightning seldom strikes twice in
the same place, though I have known
it to do so, and Mike Murphy was
too wise to try a second shot, when there
was not one chance in a million of repeating
his feat. With his loftiest air he proposed
that he and Hoke should take turns in displaying
their skill.</p>

<p>“I’ve made a bull’s eye,—do the same or
betther and I’ll take a whack and beat
<span class='it'>that</span>,—and so it will go. Am I corrict,
dochther, in me sintiments?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly; you can’t refuse Mike’s
offer, Hoke.”</p>

<p>The latter saw he was caught and accepted
the weapon as if eager for the test,
though it need not be said it was otherwise.
A vague hope stirred him that the same
exceptional success might reward his effort.
He aimed with the care and deliberation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
shown by Mike, and then pulled the trigger
five times in rapid succession.</p>

<p>“One of the bullets will be sure to land,”
was his sustaining thought, but nothing of
the kind took place. Close examination
by the three showed that Hoke had not
so much as grazed the trunk of the sapling.</p>

<p>Neither Mike nor the doctor laughed,
restrained from doing so by a chivalrous
sympathy, for Hoke could not wholly hide
his chagrin. Mike went so far as to say:</p>

<p>“Hoke, it was a chance shot on me
part, and I couldn’t do it agin in my life
time.”</p>

<p>“And now let us adjourn to dinner,”
said the doctor; “it is later than usual,
but the folks will wait for me.”</p>

<p>No words could be more welcome, but
the fun of the proceeding was that the
direction taken by the man showed that
Hoke and Mike were both wrong—as the
former had intimated—in locating the lake.
The former grinned and the latter answered
with a wink. The theme was one concerning
which it was best to say nothing.</p>

<p>The call at the forest home of Dr. Spellman
was so similar to what has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
described that it need not be dwelt upon.
Sunbeam showed her preference for the
genial Irish youth, who certainly reciprocated
her affection, as he did in the case
of Nora Friestone, whom he had met the
preceding summer farther up the Kennebec.
The mother was always gracious and won
the good opinion of every one with whom
she was brought in contact.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, and while
mother and child were busy setting things
to rights, the doctor talked with his guests.
Mike made known all that had occurred
since his previous meeting with the physician.
The latter was much interested in
the experience of that forenoon.</p>

<p>“I never saw that pile of logs, which is
doubtless the remains of some fisherman or
hunter’s cabin that either was never finished
or has been allowed to fall into decay.
I must add one thing, however,” said the
doctor gravely; “I don’t like the way
those tramps are acting.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me that about the only thing
they are doing is getting scared half to
death or swimming or running for life.”</p>

<p>“But why do they stay in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
neighborhood? The hobo doesn’t take to the woods
for long, though he may hide there when
the officers make it too hot for him.
What can there be in this part of the world
that attracts them?”</p>

<p>“They may be looking for a chance to
steal from the Boy Scouts,” suggested
Hoke.</p>

<p>“The last persons two hobos would
tackle. What chance would they have
against twenty vigorous, active, fearless
youths, who despite their peaceful principles
are yearning for stirring adventure?”</p>

<p>“Then it must be you, doctor, that they
have designs upon.”</p>

<p>“I half suspect as much; I have been
considerate to them despite their insolence,
more so than I shall be again if they annoy
us further.”</p>

<p>Turning upon the youths, Dr. Spellman
asked a question that fairly took away the
breath of the two Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>“Has either of you seen Uncle Elk and
those tramps together?”</p>

<p>Hoke was not sure he understood the
question. Mike was shocked.</p>

<p>“Why should they be togither, docther,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
unless the spalpeens called at his cabin
for food? Ye know his latchstring is always
out, but I’ve niver known of their being
in his company.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear them laughing or talking
last night, along shore, and not far
from this spot?”</p>

<p>“Be the same token I heerd two men,
but they were not the tramps.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Elk told me so.”</p>

<p>There was reproof in Mike’s tones, for
he resented the slightest reflection upon the
hermit, whom he held in high regard.
The doctor made no reply to the words of
the youth, but smoked his cigar hard and
seemed to be turning over something in
his mind that was of a displeasing nature.</p>

<p>Mike knew of course of the unaccountable
antipathy that Uncle Elk showed toward
the physician who was spending his outing
in this part of Maine. Alvin Landon and
Chester Haynes were as much mystified as
the Irish youth, and the doctor himself
claimed to have no theory that would
account for it. The last remark of the
medical man sounded as if he reciprocated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
the dislike of the hermit. Not only that
but doubtless he mistrusted him.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem any nearer the solution
of the tramps’ behavior yesterday than you
were at the time, and it looks to me as if
you will have to wait until Uncle Elk is
ready to tell you.”</p>

<p>“There saams no ither ch’ice, docther,
though I’m riddy to make another try for
the same. Will ye jine us?”</p>

<p>“No; there will be danger of Uncle Elk
and me meeting, and I am no more anxious
for it than he is. I don’t believe you will
learn anything.”</p>

<p>“We sha’n’t by standing here, as Mickey
Lanigan said whin the bull was charging
down upon him—whisht! what have we
now?”</p>

<p>Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes
walked out of the wood and smilingly
made the Boy Scout salute.</p>

<p>“Just in time not to be too late for dinner,”
was the warm greeting of Dr. Spellman,
as he shook hands with the lads. They
protested that they could not permit his
wife to bother with preparing a meal, when
the regular one had been finished a short
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
time before, but the hospitable host would
not listen, and I am compelled to say the
objections of the guests were not very
vigorous. All entered and crowded themselves
as best they could into the limited
space.</p>

<p>As the two ate, Mike and Hoke told them
of their experience at the western end of
the lake earlier in the day, while the new
arrivals had their own interesting story to
relate. They had seen two strangers enter
Uncle Elk’s cabin, only to depart soon after
in his company, as the canoe was paddled
away. The rather curious feature of this
proceeding was that neither Mike nor Hoke,
who had scanned the lake more than once,
caught sight of the craft, and Dr. Spellman
heard of it for the first time, though of
necessity the canoe passed quite close to
his home.</p>

<p>Whatever the thoughts of the physician
may have been he kept them to himself.
He had already expressed his distrust of
Uncle Elk to Mike Murphy, who was quick
to resent it, and it would be the same with
Alvin and Chester, for they held the old
man in too much esteem to listen with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
patience to anything in the way of censure
of him.</p>

<p>It might have been difficult for the doctor
to convince any unprejudiced person that
there was the slightest understanding between
the recluse or the vagrants. In fact,
the only foundation for such a charge, not
taking into account the mutual antipathy,
was the knowledge which Uncle Elk showed
of the cause of the hobos’ panic. And yet
there was a reasonable explanation of such
knowledge, which would have acquitted
the old man of any improper motive, and
it was singular that it did not occur to Dr.
Spellman.</p>

<p>The explorers, as they may be called,
now numbered four. With warm thanks
to the members of the family they bade
them good-bye and set out to continue
their quest.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that the spot
which they were to visit lay quite a little
way to the westward of Dr. Spellman’s
home. It was there that Mike Murphy had
passed under the overhanging vegetation
from which Uncle Elk soon afterward
emerged, and where the Irish youth had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
detected the odor of a cigar and heard
chuckling laughter. Mike and Hoke by
pushing into the woods, and partly losing
their way, had left this locality so far to
one side that they saw nothing of it. The
four now intended to make their way
thither.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t it be that Uncle Elk wint back,
while ye were thramping to the docther’s
house?” asked Mike, as they straggled
forward.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t fifteen minutes at a time
that we were out of sight of the lake,”
replied Alvin; “we surely should have seen
him.”</p>

<p>“He might have come back through the
woods.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Chester, “but I
see no reason why he should do so.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the same gintleman do lots of
things for which we see no raison?”</p>

<p>“Far more than we can understand.
Now I have been wondering whether he
won’t be offended by our trying to pry into
matters which should not concern us.”</p>

<p>“I think it is the other way,” said Alvin;
“he is amused by our curiosity, and doesn’t
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
tell us the secret because he enjoys our
efforts to discover it for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“And there’s no saying how long his fun
will last,” commented Mike, who because
of his previous visit to this section took upon
himself the part of guide.</p>

<p>They had tramped less than half an hour
when Mike halted and looked about him
with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>“We oughter to be there,” he remarked,
“but it saams we’re somewhere ilse.”</p>

<p>Alvin pointed to where the undergrowth,
a short distance in advance, was less
abundant than in other places.</p>

<p>“There seems to be a wagon track that
has been traveled lately.”</p>

<p>Hurrying over the few paces, they found
the supposition correct. There were the
ruts made by wagon wheels and the deep
impression of horses’ hoofs. The greatest
wonder was how any team could drag a
vehicle through such an unbroken forest.
Trees stood so close together that there
seemed hardly room for a wheelbarrow to
be shoved between, and yet a heavily laden
wagon had plunged ahead, crushing down
bushes and even small saplings, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
hubs scraping off the bark from large
trunks, but ever moving undeviatingly
in the direction of Gosling Lake.</p>

<p>“It’s the trail of the chuck wagon!”
exclaimed Chester; “it brings our supplies
that are taken across to the bungalow.”</p>

<p>“And this is the day for it,” added Alvin,
who had scarcely uttered the words when a
threshing of the wood was heard, accompanied
by the sharp cracking of a whip and
a resounding voice:</p>

<p>“Gee up! Consarn you, what’s the
matter with you? You’re purty near
there!”</p>

<p>Two powerful horses, tugging at a ponderous
open wagon piled high with boxes
of supplies, labored into sight, while the
driver, a lean, sandy-haired man perched
on the high seat, snapped his whip, jerked
the lines, clucked and urged the animals
to do their best, which they certainly did.</p>

<p>The boys stepped aside out of the way
of the team, and saluted the driver as he
came opposite and looked down upon them.
He nodded, but nothing more, for his animals
required his attention. Our young
friends fell in or followed the wagon to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
edge of the lake only a brief distance away,
where the driver flung his reins to the ground
and leaped down. He was bony, stoop-shouldered,
without coat or waistcoat, and
had his trousers tucked into the tops of his
cowhide boots.</p>

<p>“Say, I see by your dress you b’long to
the Boy Scouts,” he remarked, addressing
the whole party.</p>

<p>“We are proud to say we do,” replied
Alvin.</p>

<p>“And the Boy Scouts be proud to have
us belong to ’em,” added Mike.</p>

<p>“I should think they would be blamed
proud of <span class='it'>you</span>,” said the man with a grin.</p>

<p>“Your perciption of the truth is wonderful,
as me mither exclaimed whin Father
Meagher said I was the purtiest baby in
Tipperary.”</p>

<p>“And you chaps believe in doing a good
turn every day to some person?”</p>

<p>“Right again.”</p>

<p>“What good turn have you done anybody
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Modesty kaaps our lips mute,” replied
Mike, who for the life of him could not
recall a single incident of the nature named.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span></p>

<p>“Wal, would you like to do <span class='it'>me</span> a good
turn?”</p>

<p>“We certainly shall be glad,” Alvin took
upon himself to reply.</p>

<p>“Help me unload this wagon; the stuff
is for the Boy Scouts, so you’ll be helping
yourselves.”</p>

<h1  id='chXIV'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>CHAPTER XIV — The Men Who Laughed</h1>

<p>Before the party fell to work, the
driver walked to the edge of the lake
and tied his white handkerchief to
the limb of a tree, which projected over
the water. There was enough breeze to
make it flutter, and the background of
emerald brought it out with vivid distinctness.
It was the signal to the bungalow
that the chuck wagon, as they called it,
had arrived, and the two canoes were to be
sent across the lake for the supplies. Since
it was expected at a certain time, our
friends were on the watch for it. Within
ten minutes after the piece of linen was
fastened in place, the large canoes, each
containing two persons, one of whom was
Scout Master Hall, were seen heading for
the spot where the provisions were awaiting
them. It does not take a man and four
lusty boys long to prepare a wagon load of
such freight for shipment by water, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
the cargo was ready a good while before the
arrival of the craft.</p>

<p>The driver, who announced that he was
“Jake,” sat on one of the boxes, lighted a
corncob pipe and talked with the lads.
Although he was rough of speech and at
times inclined to profanity, the young men
treated him with respect, and by their
unvarying courtesy won his good will. He
asked many questions and told them a good
deal about himself; in short, they became
quite chummy.</p>

<p>The two canoes had passed most of the
distance when Jake abruptly asked:</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of Asa and
Bige Carter?”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Alvin in turn,
although he had heard the names before.</p>

<p>“I thought everybody knowed Asa and
Bige; they’re twin brothers, and two of the
darndest chaps that ever lived.”</p>

<p>This description, so far as it went, was
not enlightening. Chester said:</p>

<p>“Those must have been the two men
that called on Uncle Elk this morning and
went off with him in their canoe. So far
as we could see they look exactly alike.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s them,” replied Jake with a nod
of his head. “Did the three come this
way in their canoe?”</p>

<p>“They seemed to be heading for this
place.”</p>

<p>“That settles it; they was Asa and Bige.
I expected them to meet me here,” and
Jake peered around in the wood, but without
seeing anything of his friends.</p>

<p>“What might ye maan by spaking of
them as two of the darndest chaps that
ever lived?” asked Mike, who, as did his
companions, hoped they had struck a lead
that might yield them something worth
while.</p>

<p>“Why, they’re just like a couple of Irishmen.”</p>

<p>“Arrah now, but what model gintlemen
they must be! It will be an honor for us to
make their acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Jake’s reply to this was to snatch off
his straw hat, throw back his head and
roar with laughter. Determined to probe
farther, Alvin asked:</p>

<p>“What is there peculiar about the twin
brothers?”</p>

<p>“Now, you jist wait till you meet ’em
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
and you’ll find out. I’ll only warn you to
keep your eyes wide open, or they’ll close
’em for you. Wal, the folks have about
arriv.”</p>

<p>All rose to their feet and greeted their
friends who were now within a short distance.
The water was so deep that the
light craft were able to lie broadside against
the bank. It required skill and hard labor
to get a portion of the freight aboard, but
in due time it was accomplished.</p>

<p>“We are pretty heavily loaded,” remarked
Scout Master Hall, “but the lake is smooth
and we can easily make two or three trips.
We can divide you four between us.”</p>

<p>“It’s blamed risky,” commented Jake,
“but I guess it can be did if you’re all
mighty keerful.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hall insisted that he and his three
companions should change places with the
others, but this arrangement would have
defeated the scheme Alvin and his chums
had in mind. Without revealing their
object, they begged off and secured a compromise
by which Hoke Butler was to
return in one of the canoes, while the trio
would walk home. In truth, Hoke was so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
tired from his long tramp that he was
pleased by the plan.</p>

<p>“But I won’t go, Mike, if you’re going
to feel bad about it,” he remarked before
sitting down in the boat that was about to
shove off.</p>

<p>“Av coorse me heart is nearly broke,”
said Mike, “but it’s yer own comfort I’m
thinking of, as Larry McWhymper said
whin he put a brick in the bag for the cat
he was drowning to set on and pass away
comfortable. But I’m cheered by the hope
of maating ye at supper time. Good luck
to ye!”</p>

<p>The two craft, sunk almost to their gunwales,
moved slowly across the mirror-like
lake, reaching their destination without
mishap, and returning for the last
loads.</p>

<p>Jake looked at the three youths.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a mighty hard tramp afore
you; if there was a road I’d take you home
in my wagon.”</p>

<p>“We don’t mind it,” was the cheery
reply of Alvin.</p>

<p>“Besides, if we feel like resting our legs
and using our arms, we can borrow Dr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
Spellman’s boat; his home isn’t far off.
Do you go back at once?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a great mind to; it would serve Asa
and Bige right if I did, but I’ll hang round
a half hour or so and not a blamed bit
longer, for I must git home afore dark.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall bid you good bye,” said
Alvin shaking hands with the countryman,
as did the others, all expressing the hope of
soon meeting him again. Since it was he
who regularly brought the supplies to this
point, there seemed to be no reason why the
mutual wish should not be gratified. Jake
refilled and relighted his pipe, sitting on a
fallen tree and showing by his vigorous puffs
that he was not in the most patient of
moods.</p>

<p>The three boys did not speak until sure
they were beyond sight of Jake. Then
they halted.</p>

<p>“Do you think he suspects anything?”
asked Alvin, unconsciously lowering his
voice.</p>

<p>“Why should he?” asked Chester.</p>

<p>“He suspicts we’re thramping for home,”
remarked Mike, “which the same is what
we wish him to belave.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span></p>

<p>It will be understood that our young
friends were resolute to learn all that was
possible about the mystery that had tantalized
them for the past day or two. Beyond
a doubt the twin brothers were connected
with it, and since Jake was awaiting their
coming, it looked as if the boys had a fair
chance of learning something.</p>

<p>They separated, and each began an
approach to the driver and his team that
was meant to be so cautious that Jake would
not detect them. The very care used by
each well nigh defeated its purpose. It
fell to Alvin to catch the first enlightening
glimpse of the countryman and that which
he saw astonished him.</p>

<p>The Carter brothers must have been
waiting near at hand for the departure of
the boys, for in the brief interval since then
they had come forward, loaded something
in the wagon and covered it with a big
sheet of soiled canvas. Whatever it was,
its size was such that it filled the whole
interior, and crowded against the seat in
front. It towered several feet above the
sides and suggested a load of hay, protected
against a drenching rain.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span></p>

<p>“What can it be?” Alvin muttered,
“and why are they so particular with
it?” which questions were self asked by
Chester and Mike, with none able to frame
an answer.</p>

<p>Having loaded the wagon, the brothers
proceeded carefully to tuck in the precious
burden as if afraid jealous eyes might see
it. Finally all was satisfactory and the
three men climbed to the front seat. They
had to sit snugly, but there was enough
room. Jake was on the extreme right,
where he could crack his whip without
hindrance.</p>

<p>He glanced behind him, as if to make
sure everything was right, jerked the reins,
circled the whip lash which gave out an
explosion like that of a fire cracker, and
the sturdy horses bent to their task of dragging
the wagon and its contents through the
woods into the more open country, where
the smoother highway made the task easy.</p>

<p>All three men crowded on the front seat
were smoking. Jake stuck to his corncob
pipe, but each brother sported a cigar,
which by a special arrangement with Porter,
the druggist in Boothbay Harbor, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
bought for two cents apiece,—far in excess
of their worth, as any one would decide
who tested them, or even caught their odor.
With all puffing vigorously, one might fancy
that they instead of the horses supplied the
motive power.</p>

<p>From where Alvin Landon stood behind
the trunk of a large tree and peeped out, he
saw that the brothers were doing a good
deal of laughing, as if they recalled some
humorous incident. Bige gave the particulars
to Jake, who was so pleased that
he threw back his head and made the forest
ring with his laughter.</p>

<p>Since the backs of the men were turned
toward the boys, the latter did not fear to
come together to discuss their next step.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that we have learned more
than we knew before,” remarked Alvin disgustedly;
“what do you suppose they have
covered up in that wagon?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea,” replied Chester.</p>

<p>“Let’s folly the team till it gets back to
Bovil or wherever the same may be going.
Better still,” added Mike, “we can slip up
behind, lift the lid, and get a peep at the
cratur himself.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know what it may be?”</p>

<p>“I don’t, which is why I want to find
out, and the same is thrue of yersilves.”</p>

<p>They gave over the plan for more than
one reason. There was no saying how many
miles they would have to tramp, and they
could not go far without being discovered
by the men. Then the situation, to say
the least, would become embarrassing.</p>

<p>“I have the belief that we are near the
solution,” said Alvin, “and we can afford
to wait a day or two longer. We have several
miles ahead and may as well place
them behind us before nightfall. Come
on.”</p>

<p>Good taste suggested that having called
upon Dr. Spellman so recently they should
pass him by on their return to the bungalow.
This was done and they reached home without
further incident.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wagon with its mysterious
load was lurching and plunging over
the primitive road, the three men on the
front seat retaining their places with no
little difficulty, but they were used to such
traveling and no mishap followed.</p>

<p>Shortly after reaching the smoother
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
highway, Bige Carter with another laugh
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“By jingo! there they be!”</p>

<p>“You’re right; that’s them,” added his
brother.</p>

<p>The two tramps, who have already figured
to some extent in these pages, were
descried as the team turned a corner, walking
in the middle of the road. He who had
lost his hat had managed in some way to
secure another. Half of the rim was missing
and his frowsy hair showed through the
crown. As the rattle of wheels reached
their ears, he who was known as Biggs
looked around. Immediately the paths of
the two diverged, one going to the right
and the other to the left of the highway.
Both limped as if the act of walking was
painful. Naturally the team soon overtook
them. Jake, who had been talking the matter
over with his friends, stopped his horses.</p>

<p>“Whoa! wouldn’t you gentlemen like me
to give you a lift?”</p>

<p>“Now ye’re shouting, boss,” replied Biggs
as he and his companion each approached a
front wagon wheel, “but where are yer going
to put us?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span></p>

<p>“You won’t mind setting on the bottom
of the wagon in front of the stuff piled
there?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, boss; ye’re a trump.”</p>

<p>Resting one ragged shoe on a hub, the
hobos clambered in and sat down behind
the three men, who said nothing but tried
to restrain their chuckling. They knew
what was coming.</p>

<p>Biggs and Hutt drew up their legs and
compressed themselves as much as possible.
Still, with the best they could do
they were cramped. It seemed to Biggs
that a slight shifting of the freight behind
them would help matters. He hesitated
for a minute or two and then stealthily
raised one corner of the canvas covering,
his companion watching him.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the revelation
burst upon the two in the same instant. A
howl of terror rang out from each, as they
bounded to their feet and dived over the
side of the wagon. They forgot their
lameness, and ran in the direction of Gosling
Lake as if they were contestants at
Stockholm for the Marathon prize. That
single peep under the canvas had shown
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
the same appalling thing that drove them
headlong from the canoe. It was actually
near enough to touch them, and the wonder
was that they were not smitten with a
mortal dread.</p>

<p>As Jake and Bige and Asa rode on they
were so convulsed with merriment that they
surely would have fallen from their seats
had not the highway been smooth and the
pace of the horses a slow walk.</p>

<h1  id='chXV'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>CHAPTER XV — The True Story of a Famous Sea Serpent</h1>

<p>“It is over thirty years ago,” said
Uncle Elk that evening to the listening
Boy Scouts who were gathered
in the bungalow, “that the whole
country was thrown into excitement by
accounts of a stupendous sea serpent which
was repeatedly seen off the Isle of Shoals.
You know that returning mariners have
brought home stories of encounters in distant
seas with similar monstrous reptiles.
The reputation of many of these men for
truthfulness, and the fact that more than
one of them insisted that their eyes had not
deceived them, led a good many to believe
what they told. Nor am I prepared to say
that some of the accounts were not founded
on fact. In the remote past the land and
sea were inhabited by creatures of such
vast size that our largest quadrupeds are
pygmies in comparison. While the land
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
giants became extinct ages ago, it is not
unreasonable to think that the oceans which
cover three-fourths of the earth’s surface
still hold inhabitants of tremendous growth.</p>

<p>“But leaving all this discussion for the
present, I am now about to tell you the true
story of one of the greatest fakes that ever
astounded thousands of persons and amused
the dozen or so who were in the secret. In
the summer of 1879—perhaps a year earlier
or later—people everywhere became
interested in the reports that an enormous
sea serpent had been seen off the Isle of
Shoals. These stories were repeated so
often and so circumstantially that it was
evident there was something in them.
General attention was drawn to that famous
resort, and hundreds of guests visited the
Appledore Hotel for the first time and
remained for weeks. The serpent was said
to be fifty or seventy feet long, its tapering
neck, tail and general conformation were
so natural in appearance that there could
be no doubt of its reality. It was black in
color and moved through the water just as
a creature of its kind might be supposed to
do. The newspapers sent their reporters
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
thither and some of them saw it. You may
be sure that they did justice to the theme.
No one dared approach the monster near
enough to make a photograph, for none
had the temerity to run the risk of rousing
the ire of the monster. Excursion steamers
from Boston were crowded with thousands
eager to get a glimpse of the terrifying creature
without incurring any peril, for whoever
heard of a sea serpent attacking a ship?
It may crush a small boat in its prodigious
jaws, as the hippopotamus of the upper
Nile has been known to do,—but a steamer
is beyond its capacity. Many of the
passengers carried revolvers, and a number
had rifles. They begged the captain to
take them close enough to give a chance for
bagging such royal game, and he was more
than willing to oblige, but somehow or other
the opportunity did not offer. It was said
that so many craft cruising about his
haunts scared him off, and he did not show
himself for days. Then, when the search
grew less ardent, he would reappear and
the excitement would be greater than ever.</p>

<p>“Picture the piazza of the hotel, the upper
windows, and even the roof swarming with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
people, nearly all with small or large glasses
pointed out over the water, searching and
waiting minute after minute for a sight of
the terrific creature. Maybe after the scrutiny
had lasted for hours some one would
shout:</p>

<p>“‘<span class='it'>I see him! Yonder he is!</span>’</p>

<p>“And every glass would be focussed upon
the point a half mile or more away, and wild
exclamations would follow. The serpent
was in plain sight of every eye. The fore
part was upreared three or four feet, and
the most powerful binoculars revealed the
enormous eyes and vast mouth, while at
varying distances to the rear could be seen
bulging curvings of the stupendous body,
as thick as a cask. Its hideous head slowly
circled about on the neck as if the creature
enjoyed the sensation he created. Then
he dropped lower in the water, and seemed
to be reposing, occasionally disporting himself
lazily, but often displaying his terrifying
convolutions.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the news had been telegraphed
far and near, and thousands of
eager people hurried to the Isle of Shoals
for a sight which they would remember all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
their lives. If they arrived before darkness
set in they probably were gratified, for the
serpent appeared to be fond of showing
itself by daylight, but it invariably vanished
before morning and probably would not be
seen again for a week, when the former
scenes would be repeated.</p>

<p>“Scores took up quarters at the hotel,
which they had never visited before, and
stayed until the close of the season. Most
of these were rewarded by a glimpse or two
of the serpent, though a few were disappointed
and in their resentment declared
there was no such thing.</p>

<p>“Not the papers alone, but many of the
magazines contained disquisitions on the
bogy of the sea. Startling pictures based
on the numerous descriptions were given,
and caused many a shudder among those
who had to depend upon such sources of
information.</p>

<p>“One day a dudish youth loudly announced
that any man was a fool who was
afraid of a sea serpent. He intended to
row out in a boat and to go nigh enough to
empty his revolver into the frightful head.
Incidentally he let it fall that he had a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
record as a pistol expert, and he invited any
one who had the ‘sand’ to go with him for
a near view of his fight with the creature
that was making a deuced bore of itself.</p>

<p>“To the breathless amazement of the
awe-smitten listeners, two young women,
pretty of feature and with mischievous
eyes, volunteered. He warned them of the
risk they ran, but they replied that they
were not afraid of anything that failed to
alarm him, and any way they didn’t
believe the horrid creature would get a
chance to harm them before their escort
would pierce its brain with several bullets.
This tribute to the young man’s skill and
bravery caused him to set his hat at a
greater angle and thrust out his chest still
more. Many of the spectators thought it
their duty to protest, but the girls would
not be dissuaded, and a few minutes later
the boat put off with its three occupants,
while every glass or unaided eye followed
the movements of the craft.</p>

<p>“This was one of the times when the serpent
was in plain sight a half mile away,
and the young hero headed directly toward
it. The girls laughed and chatted and were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
sure it was the greatest lark in which they
had ever engaged.</p>

<p>“They noticed that as they drew near
the creature their escort showed lees enthusiasm
and kept looking over his shoulder.
It is not to be supposed they were free from
a few tremors themselves, but, if so, they
did not allow him to see it. They kept up
their laughter and commented freely upon
the timidity of the thousands who remained
upon the hotel porch and watched the sea
serpent from afar.</p>

<p>“More slowly the oars swayed until probably
a couple of hundred yards separated
the boat from that awful undulating monster.
The young man ceased toiling and
laid his hand upon the revolver in his hip
pocket.</p>

<p>“‘You are not near enough to reach
him,’ said one of the misses.</p>

<p>“‘I am best on long shots,’ he replied
with another glance at that fearful head.</p>

<p>“‘Why, he has seen us! He is looking
this way!’ exclaimed the other.</p>

<p>“‘Are you sure of that?’ he asked with
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>“‘Yes; he’s coming toward us! Isn’t
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
that splendid? All you will have to do is
to wait until he is near enough and then
shoot the horrid thing through the head as
you said you would.’</p>

<p>“But the young man had heard enough.
He whirled the boat around and rowed with
might and main, never pausing until he
reached the wharf, when he sprang out, and
amid the laughter and jeers of the spectators
rushed to his room, which he kept until
the time came for him to leave the hotel.</p>

<p>“The sea serpent was seen at intervals
all through the summer. It did not make
itself too cheap, and a week or more would
pass without its showing itself. It was
observed late in the season, but finally
disappeared for good. The Appledore
House was crowded as never before, and
ran to its fullest capacity for the two following
summers because of the general
expectation that the sea serpent would show
up again, but it never did, and in due time
became only a memory or was forgotten
entirely.</p>

<p>“When you land at the dock at Boothbay
Harbor and come up the slope to Commercial
Street, turn to the left, walk only
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
a little way and you will come to the large
grocery store of Simpson and Perkins. In
the upper hall of that store, as it used to
be, the sea serpent of which I have been
telling you was born and attained its full
growth, preliminary to its removal to the
Isle of Shoals.</p>

<p>“The author of its being was William
Wilson, who died about ten years ago. He
was an English sailor, who in middle life
gave up the sea and settled in Boothbay
Harbor, where for years he was the only
rigger in the little town. He possessed
great natural mechanical ability, and it
was said of him that he could make anything.
He was unusually skilful in plain
and fancy sewing and in constructing all
sorts of knickknacks. He turned his
attention to house painting and in that
developed real artistic taste. In short, he
was a Jack-of-all-trades and good in each.</p>

<p>“One day a stranger who had heard of
Wilson’s versatility came to him with a
proposition that he should construct him a
sea serpent, for which he was willing to pay
two hundred dollars. He explained its
purpose and impressed upon the artist the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
necessity of keeping the thing an absolute
secret,—since the discovery that it was a
fake would defeat the very object of its
being, which was to build up business for
the hotel at the Isle of Shoals.</p>

<p>“Wilson agreed to construct the sea serpent
in accordance with his own ideas of
what it should be. His employer was quite
willing to accept this proviso, for he knew
the man’s ingenuity and so the verbal contract
was made.</p>

<p>“Wilson had a partner in the work, a
Swede named Robert Alson, who is still
living. These two used to saunter upstairs
into the long hall which was their workshop,
lock the door and devote themselves to the
task, upon which they spent their spare
hours throughout the winter. Like a true
artist, Wilson would not hurry, and gave
careful attention to the smaller details,—a
fact which accounts for the perfect success
of the extraordinary fraud.</p>

<p>“The sea serpent was exactly thirty-five
feet long, and for convenience of shipment
was made in three sections, which overlapped
and could be readily sewn together.
The material was strong canvas, painted a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
black color, with proper proportions. The
tail tapered, as did the neck, the largest part
of the body being about two feet in diameter.
The head, eyes and mouth were not
exaggerated, as would have been the fact
with almost any amateur at the job. It
was stuffed with cork and oak shavings, so
nicely adjusted that it would float partly
on or just below the surface, with the curving
neck lifting the hideous head two or
three feet above the water. The small
waves gave a lifelike motion to the thing,
which made it seem to be moving slowly
through the water, when in fact it never
progressed forward or backward, for its
position was held immovably by an anchor.</p>

<p>“When the serpent was at last completed
it was securely boxed and shipped
to Portsmouth, six miles from the Isle of
Shoals. Then it was towed at night to the
right place, anchored and left to do its duty,
which, as I have told you, it succeeded in
doing to perfection. It is strange that the
imposture was kept up for month after-month,
and that it was seen and inspected
by thousands, and yet no one really penetrated
the clever deception. It was towed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
to the anchorage at night, and taken away
again the next night to a secure hiding
place. Those who had it in charge were
too shrewd to overdo the trick. When the
attention of the crowds threatened to
become too warm, the serpent disappeared
and was not again seen for a week or more.
The general belief was that it had gone out
to sea, but after a time some strange attraction
drew it back into the field of vision of
the swarms of visitors to the Appledore
Hotel. As I said, the sea serpent disappeared
for good in the autumn and this
particular one was never seen again—that
is, in its native element. I do not know
what ultimately became of it.”</p>

<p>At this point in the narrative Uncle Elk
paused, and it could be seen that he was
smiling behind his beard.</p>

<p>“I now want to say something to you in
confidence. You must be sure not to repeat
it in the hearing of others. I gave you the
names of the two men who built the sea
serpent, but I have good reason to believe
a third person had a hand in it. If you will
question Keyes H. Richards, the proprietor
of the Samoset House on Mouse
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
Island, you will find that he knows all
about it. I once asked him point blank if
he did not have something to do with its
construction, but I could not draw a direct
answer from him. Therefore, I retain my
suspicions.</p>

<p>“Last spring the twin brothers, Asa and
Bige Carter of Boothbay, persuaded themselves
that they could make a tidy sum of
money by introducing a new sea serpent to
the public. After they had completed it,
they decided to make a preliminary test by
bringing it to Gosling Lake and trying it
on you Boy Scouts. They let me into the
secret, and though much interested, I discouraged
it. They lacked the artistic
cleverness of Wilson and the trick was sure
to be detected and quickly exposed. I met
them on the shore of the lake and saw them
tow it out a little way, and anchor it. It
was not properly balanced, and while the
body sank, the head rose to within a foot
of the surface, but would not come any
higher. When those two tramps happened
to look over the edge of their canoe, you
may perhaps imagine their terror at sight
of the gently swaying monstrosity that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
seemed on the point of crushing the boat or
them in its jaws. Never again will they be
so overcome with blind panic.</p>

<p>“This incident, together with my earnest
persuasions, induced the Carter boys to
give up their scheme and to take away their
sea serpent and consign it to oblivion.”</p>

<h1  id='chXVI'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>CHAPTER XVI — Zip</h1>

<p>On the evening succeeding the interesting
story told by Uncle Elk of
the once famous sea serpent, the
majority of the Boy Scouts were seated on
the porch of the bungalow exchanging the
day’s experiences. The half dozen detailed
to prepare supper were as busy as they
could be, for they like their waiting companions
were exceedingly a-hungered. Some
had spent hours in fishing for perch, bass,
salmon, pickerel and lake trout; others had
strolled through the fragrant, resinous
woods, studying trees and bird life, and all
had added to their splendid reserve of
rugged health, exuberant animal spirits,
and that genuine happiness which comes
only with an upright life, clean habits and
the constant seeking of an opportunity to
do others a “good turn.”</p>

<p>The day had been an ideal one, overflowing
with radiant sunshine, surcharged
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
with ozone and with a sky of a crystalline
clearness which Italy throughout all its
historic centuries has never surpassed. The
summer was drawing to a close; the nights
were perceptibly longer, and there was a
crisp coolness which increased after sunset
and told of the coming of autumn and
winter.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall sat among his boys
looking out upon the placid lake, the conversation
rambling and not important
enough to call for record. The chair in
which Jack Crandall reclined while he
talked had been carried inside by two of
the Scouts, Doctor Spellman having advised
that this should be done now that the
weather was growing chilly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Gerald Hume, of the Stag
Patrol, who sat nearest to the end of the
porch, said:</p>

<p>“Hello? we have a visitor.”</p>

<p>A general turning of heads followed.
Coming along the beach from the direction
of Uncle Elk’s home was a boy, probably
fifteen or sixteen years old, rather tall for
his age, dressed in khaki, with leggings, a
close-fitting cap and short coat with belt
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
around the waist. While his attire resembled
in some respects that of the Boy
Scouts, it was not the same. He swung a
swagger or short cane in his right hand, and
advanced with the elastic grace of an athlete.
As he drew nearer it was seen that
he had a pleasing face, with regular features,
dark eyes and hair, and that air which
while it cannot be described, yet reveals
the polish and culture of the true gentleman.</p>

<p>Glancing aside at the boys who were busy
with their culinary duties, he stepped lightly
upon the porch and with a military salute
called out:</p>

<p>“Good evening, boys; I am glad to meet
you.”</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall and every youth
sprang to their feet and made the regulation
salute, the leader advancing and offering
his hand.</p>

<p>“And I assure you we are all pleased to
welcome you. You are in time to join us
at supper and of course will stay over night.
Are you alone?”</p>

<p>“I am; my name is George Burton and
my home is in the city of New York. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
am spending a week or two at the Hotel
Samoset on Mouse Island, but must soon
leave to meet my folks on their return from
the other side.”</p>

<p>“Did you come from Mouse Island
to-day?” inquired Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>“I left there early this morning; crossed
to Boothbay Harbor and then struck
on foot, just as my brother and I did last
summer in tramping through Switzerland.
A farmer gave me a ride of several miles,
when I resorted to shanks-mare again.
Then I caught another ride—not quite so
long as the former—until I came to the
half-broken track through the woods, over
which I believe the wagon labors that brings
your supplies. I had heard that a party of
Boy Scouts were stopping at the clubhouse,
which I saw from the other side of the lake,
so I skirted the sheet of water to this point.”</p>

<p>“That makes a pretty good tramp for one
day,” remarked the Scout Master.</p>

<p>“I have done a good deal better, and I
am sure it would not tax any one of you.
You asked me a few minutes ago if I were
alone; I am, but I expect soon to be joined
by a friend.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span></p>

<p>Young Burton laughed at the surprised
looks turned toward him.</p>

<p>“He is my dog, named Zip.”</p>

<p>“He will be as welcome as his master,”
said Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>“I know that and I thank you for us both.”</p>

<p>“It’s mesilf that is wondering why ye
don’t kaap company,” said Mike Murphy;
“me dad explained to Father Hoogan, as
his rason for taking me wid him whereiver
he wint, that he liked to have a pup at his
heels whin he wandered round the country.”</p>

<p>The visitor smiled at the Irish lad’s
drollery, and was on the point of answering
the query, when the Scouts in charge of the
dinner preparations announced that the
meal was ready.</p>

<p>“We are all curious to hear your story,
which we know is interesting,” remarked
the Scout Master as he and the boys rose
to their feet, “but nothing can be so attractive
just now as the meal to which we have
just been summoned.”</p>

<p>“I am of your opinion,” replied Burton,
moving off with the others to the table.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span></p>

<p>“May I ask when you look for the arrival
of your friend Zip?”</p>

<p>The guest took out his watch and
glanced at its face.</p>

<p>“It is now half-past six; he ought to be
here by seven; I must allow him some
margin.”</p>

<p>Every one was puzzled, but made no
comment. As the Scout Master had
remarked, the question of satisfying their
hunger dominated all others for the time.</p>

<p>Needless to say the whole party partook
of the food with the satisfying enjoyment
which waits on sound health and exuberant
spirits. As Scout Master Hall quoted, all
“ate like horses when you hear them eat,”
the feast enlivened by continuous chatter,
jest and merriment. Jack Crandall’s chair
was wheeled to the table, and with a little
help from his friends he did his part well.
Less than half an hour thus passed, when
the company adjourned to the front porch,
the only absent ones being the half dozen
who had to clean up and leave things ready
for the morning meal. This work did not
take long, and all were soon gathered
together, the Scouts much interested in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
their guest, and what he told them about
his dog Zip.</p>

<p>“He is a bloodhound,” he explained,
“not quite two years old. The breed is
not specially noted for its intelligence, but
its delicacy or power of scent would be unbelievable
had it not been proved over and
over again. I hope to give you some
demonstrations by my own dog, who is of
pure breed, and with more brains than the
generality of his kind.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure he will trail you to this
place?” asked Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>“There is not a particle of doubt about
it. He has performed more difficult feats
than that; in fact, I am trying to find something
he cannot do, but so far haven’t
succeeded.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us the particulars of his
present task?”</p>

<p>“I left Mouse Island this morning about
seven o’clock on the <span class='it'>Norman II</span>, run by Captain
Pinkham. Having made my arrangements
with Manager Dodge, I explained to
my friend Chester Greenleaf that Zip would
be at the dock and board the boat at twenty
minutes to two for the roundabout trip to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
Boothbay Harbor. I advised Greenleaf not
to try to collect a ticket from Zip, as he
might resent it, and the young man promised
to bear the counsel in mind. All that
was to be done was to take the pup to the
wharf at Boothbay and leave him to do the
rest.</p>

<p>“Zip didn’t like the idea of being left
behind at Mouse, but he knew what was
expected of him, and stood quietly on the
dock as with a lugubrious expression he
watched me go. I waved my hand at him,
and he wagged his tail in return, as much as
to say I couldn’t lose him in that fashion.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Burton animatedly, “consider
what Zip has had to do. He left
Mouse Island at twenty minutes to two
o’clock this afternoon and reached Boothbay
Harbor at about half past two, which
was fully seven hours behind me. I’ll warrant
he was the first one ashore, and in a
twinkling picked up my trail and was speeding
northward from the town. Two miles
out he lost it for the time because I had a
lift from a farmer, but Zip knew what that
meant, and he loped on up the road, certain
of discovering when I left the vehicle.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it possible,” asked Scout Master
Hall, “that he could keep your scent while
you were riding in a wagon?”</p>

<p>“I am not prepared to deny it, incredible
as it may sound. A bloodhound has
been known to trot twenty feet to one side
of a trail along a broad highway, and not lose
it for miles. Zip is so familiar with my
scent that he may have detected it from
the first. Be that as it may, he lost no
time in nosing about the road, but detected
the very spot where my foot again touched
ground, and was after me like a thunderbolt.
I had a second ride—not quite so
long as the first—which brought me to the
rough unbroken track over which your supply
wagon brings your provisions. It was a
long tramp to this place, and, as you know,
the afternoon was gone when I arrived.”</p>

<p>“Did you make any attempts to throw
him off your track?”</p>

<p>“No, for it was useless. Had a canoe
been at hand I might have crossed the lake
in it, but that would have been unfair, for
of course no trail can be followed through
water, since in the nature of things none
can be made.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span></p>

<p>“Since I have been specially interested
in this breed of dogs,” young Burton modestly
added, “I may have picked up a few
points that are not familiar to all of you.”</p>

<p>“There is no question as to that,” replied
Scout Master Hall, “you have already
proved it; you are telling us facts that are
not only new to us but of special interest.
All the boys feel as I do.”</p>

<p>A general murmur of assent followed.</p>

<p>“You are more complimentary than I
deserve. While the bloodhound is not the
most common breed of dogs in this country,
I suppose most of you are familiar with his
looks and history. They were once used
in Cuba to track escaping prisoners and
runaway slaves, and probably served the
same purpose in some parts of the South
before the Civil War, but in our country
they were employed simply to track the
negroes and were trained not to harm
them, for, aside from the cruelty of the
act, it was against the interests of the slave
owner to injure his own property. In
Cuba, the bloodhounds were like ravening
tigers. The poor wretch in threshing
through the thickets and swamps heard the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
horrible baying fast drawing nearer. His
only escape was to leap among the limbs
of a tree, and climb beyond reach of the
brutes. If he was tardy in doing so, the
black terror that burst through the undergrowth
buried his fangs in his throat the
next instant and never let go, no matter
how desperately the man fought.”</p>

<p>“How was it when the poor fellow reached
a perch?”</p>

<p>“The dogs sat down and waited until
the pursuers came up and claimed the
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the slave took to water?”</p>

<p>“He was pretty sure to do that sooner
or later, but it rarely availed against the
marvelous scent of his enemies. After a
time the man had to leave the creek or
river, as it might be, and with two or three
or more bloodhounds trotting along the
bank with their muzzle to the ground, they
were certain to pick up the scent with little
or no loss of time.</p>

<p>“This peculiarly Spanish product became
famous during the war with the Seminole
Indians of Florida some seventy years ago.
You know that those redskins retreated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
into the swamps and everglades where our
soldiers could not follow them, or, if they
followed, could not find them. The war
dragged on year after year until the patience
of the government was worn out. In its
perplexity a number of Cuban bloodhounds
were imported; and, although our officers
took pains to declare that the dogs would
be used to track and not to rend the Seminoles,
an indignant protest went up against
the barbarity of the act.</p>

<p>“But,” added young Burton with a laugh,
“the crime, if it were such, worked its own
remedy. Somehow or other the Indians
learned to make friends with the black
brutes which came to them in the swamps,
and they trained them with so much skill
that they used them to hunt down the
stray soldiers and former owners. The
use of bloodhounds in the Seminole war
proved a farce.”</p>

<p>The guest suddenly ceased talking for a
moment and said:</p>

<p>“It is time I heard from Zip.”</p>

<p>“Some accident may have befallen him
or perhaps he has gone astray.”</p>

<p>“Both are improbable—listen!”</p>

<h1  id='chXVII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>CHAPTER XVII — Wonderful Work</h1>

<p>Absolute hush followed the exclamation
of young Burton and, as all
were intently listening, there sounded
through the soft stillness of the night a
strange, piercing cry,—the baying of a
bloodhound following the trail of a person.
It was neither a bark nor a growl, but a
mixture of the two,—a deep howl that
might well fill a fleeing fugitive with shivering
fear.</p>

<p>“That’s Zip,” said his pleased owner;
“he will be here in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“He has a remarkable voice,” said Scout
Master Hall; “I never heard the like.”</p>

<p>Mike Murphy, who had been one of the
most absorbed of listeners and was seated
near the guest, rose to his feet and emitted
a cry which, so far as the listeners could
tell, was an absolutely perfect imitation of
that of the dog.</p>

<p>“That’s wonderful!” exclaimed Burton;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
“it would deceive any one except the dog
himself.”</p>

<p>“And why not him?” asked Alvin Landon.</p>

<p>“Because he does not answer—there he
comes!”</p>

<p>In the dim moonlight, as every eye was
turned in the direction of the beach leading
toward Uncle Elk’s cabin, the Scouts saw
a black, medium sized dog approaching at
full speed, his sturdy figure rapidly assuming
definite form. It was to be noted that
Burton had come through the wood itself,
whereas the animal was traversing the
beach, where the way was more open, yet
he was keeping to the trail as unerringly as
an arrow driven from the bow.</p>

<p>“Hide yourself,” whispered Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>“There is no place where I can hide from
him.”</p>

<p>The next instant the hound with undiminished
speed bounded up the steps at the
end of the porch, dashed between the boys,
and impinged with such force against his
standing master that he was knocked backward
for a pace or two. Bending over,
Burton patted the big head, and Zip in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
excess of delight bounded round the youth
and wagged his tail so hard that it swayed
his haunches correspondingly, and it really
seemed an instance of the tail wagging the
dog.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think Zip will appreciate
something in the form of a meal?” asked
Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>“He certainly will; a dog is always hungry,
and more than half a day has passed
since he ate; nothing suits him better than
raw meat.”</p>

<p>“We have a supply, and he shall feast to
his heart’s content.”</p>

<p>So he did, the food being brought out
and placed in front of the canine guest, who
would have eaten a good deal more had
his master permitted. Meekly accepting
the decision, Zip lay down at young Burton’s
feet, contented and happy throughout
the remainder of the evening, and glad to
stay outside until the youth rejoined him
in the morning.</p>

<p>“You know what matchless policemen
the Belgian dogs make in that country, in
France, and in New York and other cities.
Some three years ago Long Island became
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
so pestered by thieves that Robert E. Kerkham,
superintendent of the railway police,
saw that something drastic had to be done.
The thieves dynamited station safes, burglarized
private dwellings and more than
once killed and injured railway policemen
while they were trying to arrest the criminals.
Those men used fleet horses and automobiles,
and despite everything that could
be done, grew bolder and more successful.</p>

<p>“Superintendent Kerkham, finding that
his patrolmen were powerless, decided to
call in the help of dogs, with whose striking
success abroad and at home he was familiar,
but he made a new departure by taking
bloodhounds instead of the usual police
dogs, for the former would not only guard
property but would track the thieves. He
bought a pair from the stock imported from
England more than twenty years ago.
These are of the purest blood, and superior
to all others. Zip is from the same stock.
A peculiarity of this dog is that in no circumstances
will he take up a doubtful trail,
but will pick up the true scent, no matter
how faint, and never abandon it so long as
it actually exists. They know not the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
meaning of fear, and will stick to their work
so long as they can move or breathe. Some
of those dogs have pedigrees that reach
backward to the time of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>“The couple which Mr. Kerkham purchased
are named Bob and Nellie. They
had to be trained, but they learned fast.
They will take the scent from any article
that has been lately handled by the person
they are after.”</p>

<p>“How old a trail will serve them?” asked
the Scout Master.</p>

<p>“Of course the freshest scent is the best.
Zip was all of seven hours behind me
to-day. I have tested him on double that
time and he seemed to have little or no difficulty.
They have taken a trail twenty-four
hours old, and precisely what it is that
guides them in such a case is more than any
one can understand. A man is known to
have left a house at a certain time, and
twenty hours later it is decided to pursue
him with the aid of a bloodhound. A glove,
or hat, or shoe that he is known to have
worn is held in front of the dog; he sniffs
at it, dashes out of doors, circles back and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
forth and around the grounds until he strikes
the corresponding scent; up goes his head,
his tail wags and he bays his pleasure. A
hundred yards farther, and he drops his
nose to the ground to make sure he has
not lost his clue.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the scent grows faint or disappears.
In that case he runs back and circles
about until he picks it up again, when
he is off once more. You must remember
that while all this is going on there is a
man tugging at the leash, for this is necessary
to protect the thief. As the trail grows
fresher, the fierce eagerness of the hound
increases; he knows he is close upon his
quarry and sharp words and powerful pulling
are necessary to prevent him from
bounding straight at the throat of the cowering
wretch. Should he start to run it is
almost impossible to restrain the dog, but
when he sees the criminal is under arrest,
he is satisfied, becomes quiet, and is ready
to tackle the next job.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us of some of the exploits
of Bob and Nellie, who you say are perfect
specimens of their kind?”</p>

<p>“I cannot recall a quarter of them. One
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
thing that Bob did was astonishing because
it was at the beginning of his training and
the scent was fourteen hours old. He
caught it from a bag which the thieves had
used to wrap about their hands in breaking
a window. As true as the needle to the
pole, Bob led his master through alleys and
side streets, across vacant lots, along the
purlieus of a straggling village to a house
near the highway. This was circled once,
and then he dashed to a barn at the rear,
through the open door, and sprang at a
young man who was engaged in skinning a
muskrat he had trapped.</p>

<p>“The fellow was indignant and denied all
knowledge of the crime, declaring that he
did not know where the freight house was
located, but Bob’s trainer was certain the
dog was right, and searched the place. All
the missing property was found in a trunk,
and the thief is now in Sing Sing, convicted
on the testimony of the dog.</p>

<p>“Last summer a farmer in Kansas was
murdered and a pack of hounds were put
on the trail. They led the trainers and officers
through a broken country for six miles,
never hesitating or turning aside for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
minute, until they reached a house where a
man lived who had never been suspected.
He was arrested, corroborative evidence
obtained, and he was convicted by the
Supreme Court of the state and executed.</p>

<p>“One night the safe of the Hicksville station
on the Long Island Railroad was blown
open and the contents stolen. Three of
the dogs were brought up the next day a
little before noon and put on the trail,
about twelve hours after the robbery had
been committed.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” remarked Scout Master
Hall, “that in all such cases the hounds
are very liable to blunder.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“There must be a good many tracks
about the premises; how can they differentiate
those of the thieves?”</p>

<p>“They took the scent without the least
difficulty from the window through which
the robbers had entered and from the articles
they had handled. Tugging at their
leashes, the hounds led their masters up
the railway track for an eighth of a mile, and
then turned off across the open country to
the trolley track, which they followed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
the next stop, where the trail ended.
Inquiries brought out the fact that the car
had stopped there about midnight,—something
which it rarely did. Having boarded
it, the thieves made their escape, and that
became one of the few instances in which
the skill of the bloodhounds came to
naught.</p>

<p>“But the dogs were not allowed to rust
for want of work. Long Island gave them
plenty to do, and continues to do so.
When word came to headquarters that the
station at Warwick Street on the Atlantic
Division of the railway had been broken
into and robbed, the dogs were put on the
job with the least possible delay. They
found the trail without trouble, and skurried
down Atlantic Avenue to Logan Street,
where the canines halted for consultation,
since they had to face new conditions.</p>

<p>“These wonderful brutes had been instant
to detect that two thieves were concerned
in the crime. At the point named, the trail
divided, and of course the pursuers did the
same. Our old friend Bob trotted along
until he reached No. 129, where he sat down,
threw up his head and began howling. Jim,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
the other dog, kept on to No. 219, where he
joined in the dismal chorus. The two were
on the same side of the street, not very far
apart, and must have made a striking picture,
as from their different stations they
serenaded some persons within. I can’t
help wondering,” added young Burton with
a laugh, “whether the thieves noticed that
howling, and peeping out of the windows
suspected what it meant.</p>

<p>“The trainers thought it possible a mistake
had been made, and the dogs were
taken back to the station and given the
scent again. They followed it as unerringly
as before, but oddly enough when
they came to the forking of the trail, Bob
and Jim changed places. It was as if one
had proposed the shift to the other, who
accepted it offhand.</p>

<p>“Doubting no longer, the officers arrested
a schoolboy in each house, whom the dogs
identified. They confessed their guilt, and
one was sent to the Juvenile Asylum at
Dobbs Ferry and the other to the Elmira
Reformatory.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Burton, whose enthusiasm
was natural, “can any one understand what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
it is that guides the bloodhound? Of course
it is some sort of emanation, but how subtle
it must be, and how fine the sense that
can identify it among scores of others! In
the incident I have just related, the trail
led through busy streets, where hundreds
of men, women and animals had trodden
upon the invisible footprints, each with his
or her peculiar odor, which lingered for
hours, and was as distinct to the dogs as
the call of a megaphone is to us. It is
beyond my comprehension.”</p>

<p>“It is beyond the comprehension of any
one,” added Mr. Hall. “Bertillon has
proved that the thumb prints of no two
persons are the same, and so the scent of
every one has a peculiarity of its own, but
that doesn’t lessen our wonder.</p>

<p>“There is no end to the proofs that have
been given of their miraculous power.”</p>

<p>“The dogs, I suppose, seem to enjoy
tracking a criminal?”</p>

<p>“It is their delight. Although not credited
with a high order of intelligence, they
know as well as their trainers what is
expected of them, and enter into it with as
much gusto as you boys do your vacation.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span></p>

<p>“Is a criminal when overtaken by the
dogs in danger of being hurt by them?”</p>

<p>“It depends upon himself. If he continues
to run and puts up a fight they will
attack him. If he quietly submits, they
will mount guard and hold him unharmed
until their master comes up and takes the
criminal into custody. Then the dogs,
seeing that that particular task is finished,
show by their behavior that they are as
eager as ever for their next job. But, for
safety’s sake, they are generally held in
leash, master and dog keeping company.”</p>

<p>“How is it with Zip?”</p>

<p>“He always runs free, and will not harm
a fugitive unless ordered to do so. You
understand that he and I are chums, and
I have never used him to chase a criminal.
He roams through the country, and I keep
him on edge by such tests as to-day. He
is so familiar with my scent that he will
pick it up instantly, without first sniffing
articles I have worn. The other day I
played a mean trick on him. I left him at
the Samoset House on Mouse Island and
started for Boothbay Harbor on the steamer
<span class='it'>Wiwurna</span>, but instead of getting off at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
wharf, I slipped over the gunwale at the
rear, and Captain Free McKown took me
on board his motor boat <span class='it'>Edith</span> which was
lying near, and started back to Mouse
Island with me. Just before reaching the
dock I met the <span class='it'>Norman II</span> starting for
Boothbay and seated on his haunches at
the prow was Zip. I was not expecting to
see him and I should have got out of sight,
but he discovered me and emitted the most
dissatisfied howl I ever heard. It said as
plain as so many words, ‘You played me a
low down trick, and I don’t like it.’ He
would have sprung overboard and tried to
swim to me, had I not forbidden him.
Perforce he went on to Boothbay and came
back on the <span class='it'>Norman II</span>. I was in my room
when he scratched on my door and I
admitted him. He was so mad that he
refused to eat the meat prepared for him,
and pouted the rest of the day. I apologized
and coaxed, and by night had won
back his favor and the cloud between us
passed away.”</p>

<h1  id='chXVIII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>CHAPTER XVIII — A Match of Wits</h1>

<p>It may be said that Zip had become the
hero of the Boy Scout camp on Gosling
Lake. He belonged to the finest breed
of bloodhounds in the world and had given
an illustration of that gift of his species
which approaches the miraculous. The
stories told by his master of his other
exploits, and of what had been done by his
kind on Long Island and elsewhere, were
absorbingly interesting. As young Burton
remarked, his study of this canine species
had given him more knowledge than could
have been the case otherwise, and he
naturally did most of the talking on that
cool August night in front of the bungalow.
The bloodhound is one of the most dignified
of dogs, and resents anything in the
nature of familiarity by strangers. Alvin,
Chester, Mike and several others tried to
make friends with Zip, but he showed them
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
plainly that he preferred to be left to
himself.</p>

<p>“Ef it was meself that was as partic’lar
as him to selict me associates,” said Mike,
“I should faal mighty lonely, as Jim
O’Toole remarked after he had been lost
for six weeks in the woods. I’ll remimber
yer coolness, Zip,” he added, shaking his
finger at the dog nestling at the feet of
Burton, “and to-morrer ye’ll faal so
ashamed, after ye try to match wits wid me,
that ye’ll resign as a bloodhound and
become a poodle dog for the rist of yer
days.”</p>

<p>“Don’t boast too soon,” said the guest;
“I’ll put my stake on Zip every time.”</p>

<p>“And so will I,” added Alvin; “if Mike
was half as smart as he thinks he is, we
should all be fools compared with him.”</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Some</span> folks don’t naad the comparisin
to show they’re lacking in the first ilimints
of sense,” retorted the Irish youth with fine
sarcasm.</p>

<p>It was quite late when the boys retired
for the night. No one would have objected
to the presence of Zip in the bungalow, but
his master preferred that he should spend
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
the night outdoors, and he was waiting
there the next morning when Burton, the
first to arise, came out to have a romp with
him before breakfast.</p>

<p>It was about eight o’clock that the
whole party of Boy Scouts including their
guest gathered on the front porch, eagerly
interested in the test that was to be made
of the skill of Zip the bloodhound in following
a scent. Every one was on the <span class='it'>qui vive</span>,
for the novelty of the proceeding appealed to them.</p>

<p>The arrangements, simple of themselves,
had been made while the party was at
breakfast. Three trials were to take place,
involving that number of Boy Scouts.
Each was to plunge into the woods and use
every device possible to hide his trail from
the dog, which was to take up his task an
hour after the fugitive, as he may be called,
left the bungalow.</p>

<p>The first runner was the diminutive
Isaac Rothstein, the second, the tall, long-limbed
Hoke Butler, and the third Mike
Murphy.</p>

<p>“There is only one condition,” said
young Burton, when everything was ready;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
“you must not make any use of the lake.
Zip can track you only to the edge.”</p>

<p>“The lake is the only water shut out?”
remarked Hoke Butler inquiringly. The
guest hesitated a moment, suspecting some
intended trick by the questioner.</p>

<p>“That is all.”</p>

<p>“How about the Sheepscot River?” asked
Mike.</p>

<p>“If an hour’s start will enable you to
reach that stream ahead of Zip, you win.”</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall turned to Isaac, who
was standing in the middle of the group on
the porch. The bright-eyed youth nodded.</p>

<p>Burton spoke to the hound which, knowing
what was expected of him, came forward
and sniffed around the Boy Scout’s
feet and ankles. He did this for only two
or three seconds, when he backed off and
took his place beside his master.</p>

<p>“That means he is ready if you are.”</p>

<p>“I am to have an hour’s start?”</p>

<p>“More if you wish it.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, and you are sure he will
not attack me?”</p>

<p>“Have no fear of that, but I suggest that
you do not tempt him.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked
young Rothstein.</p>

<p>“Don’t tackle <span class='it'>him</span> first; and when he
comes up with you, as he is sure to do, stop
running. The Belgian dogs have a trick
of dodging between the legs of a fugitive
and tripping him, but the bloodhound prefers
to drag him down.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” said Mike, “whin the
dog gits ye down, and has his paws on yer
breast, and is hunting out the best place
to begin his feast, h’ist the flag of truce.”</p>

<p>Isaac, accompanied by Scout Master
Hall and several of the boys, passed into
the bungalow, closing the door behind them,
and went out of the rear door which was
also shut. The dog remained on the front
porch with his master and the other scouts,
each party out of sight of the other. A
few minutes later, Isaac’s friends rejoined
their comrades, Burton and several of the
Scouts glancing at their watches to note the
time. Zip lay at his owner’s feet, with his
nose between his paws, as if intending to
pass the interval in sleep.</p>

<p>Before starting, Isaac was asked to
explain his plan. He replied that it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
merely to do everything he could to puzzle
his pursuer, and he was confident of succeeding.
It was useless to make any effort
at the start, and he walked away at his
ordinary pace, quickly disappearing among
the trees.</p>

<p>The moment, however, he was out of
sight he began the precautions he had
decided upon before starting. He turned
at right angles, walked rapidly for a hundred
yards, then changed again to the
same extent. Since the shift each time was
to the right, this made an exact reversal of
the course upon which he set out, and being
kept for a little while took him back to the
bungalow, a rod or two from his starting
point. No one saw him, since every one
was at the front. Thus he made a second
get away, which delayed him for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Isaac chuckled, for he was sure he had
played a cute trick upon the dog, which he
believed would be puzzled thereby, and yet
you and I can readily see that there was
“nothing in it” at all.</p>

<p>Again the youth dived in among the
trees, or broke into a rapid run, going
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
straightaway, but taking as long steps as
he could. Then he zig-zagged, first to the
right and left, describing irregular circles
which assuredly would have led him astray
had he not caught glimpses of the lake
now and then, and thus knew the course he
was following, which in the main was toward
the cabin of Uncle Elk.</p>

<p>He kept note of the time, and just before
the hour expired made a long sweeping
curve to the right, which brought him back
to the opposite end of the bungalow from
his starting point.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he called as he bounded up
the steps among his friends; “where’s
Zip?”</p>

<p>“On your trail,” replied his owner.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that; I’ve given
him the task of his life.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly the easiest one; now that
you have returned,” said Burton, “you
may as well tell us everything you did.”</p>

<p>Isaac described his course from the first,—how
he had actually started twice, often
shifting and finally making a big curve,
still marked by abrupt changes that were
sure to baffle the keenest nosed bloodhound
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
that ever tracked a fugitive into the depths
of the Everglades.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have given Zip an easier
task,” said Burton; “when he left here a
short time ago he circled about the clubhouse,
and in three minutes at the most
took your scent.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t the two trails puzzle him?”
asked the astonished Isaac.</p>

<p>“There was a difference of a few minutes
in their making and he took the freshest.”</p>

<p>This sounded so incredible that the guest
qualified his assertion.</p>

<p>“Even if he accepted the older scent, it
led him straight to the second. All your
circlings and doublings availed you nothing;
you never perplexed him for more than an
instant.”</p>

<p>“How can you know that?”</p>

<p>“There’s your answer.”</p>

<p>Burton nodded toward the steps up which
Isaac Rothstein had come some time before.
There was Zip, who without baying or
making any kind of outcry, galloped over
the porch and directly to where the
astounded lad was sitting. Stepping a
pace or two away, he looked up at the youth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
and then walked over to his master and sat
down beside his chair.</p>

<p>“You can translate his remarks,” said
the latter. “Words could not be plainer:
‘There’s the young man who thought he
could fool me, but never was he more mistaken.’”</p>

<p>Isaac joined in the clapping of hands.
Zip preserved his dignity and paid no heed
to strangers. All he cared for was the good
opinion of his master and he knew he had
that.</p>

<p>“Next!” called Burton, and the tall,
stoop-shouldered Hoke Butler rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any help,” he remarked
with a wink toward Isaac Rothstein, as Zip
sniffed about his feet; “stay right where
you are. Mr. Burton, a half hour start
will be enough for me.”</p>

<p>“As you please, but you may have two
hours if you wish.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll save our bouquets till Zip
throws up the sponge,” said Mike, “or
rather until I tries me hand with the
intilligint canine.”</p>

<p>Instead of leaving the bungalow from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
the rear, Hoke walked deliberately down the
eastern steps, and sauntered off where he
was in plain sight of all until he entered
the wood which approached to within a
few rods of the lake. He had given no one
a hint of the scheme he had in mind, but
the feeling was general that whatever its
nature it was original, and more than one-half
suspected he might outwit the remarkable
dog. In this list we must not include
George Burton.</p>

<p>Now Hoke had learned that it was useless
to try to throw Zip off the scent by any
such artifices as young Rothstein had used.
As the guest declared, the tracker had not
bothered the dog to the slightest extent.
It therefore would be folly for the second
fugitive to repeat the experiment. He had
no thought of doing so.</p>

<p>Mention has been made in the preceding
pages of a brook which ran near the home
of Uncle Elk. After a devious course this
emptied into Gosling Lake at a point about
halfway between the cabin and the bungalow.
Hoke rested his hopes upon this little
stream.</p>

<p>“Burton barred the lake,” chuckled the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
youth, “but he didn’t say anything of this
stream, though I was awfully afraid he
would. I guess he doesn’t know about it,—yes,
he does, too, for he had to cross it
on his way to the bungalow, but he forgot
it. He can’t kick when he finds I have
made his dog sing small.”</p>

<p>Allured by the single purpose, Hoke
pushed straight on, turning neither to the
right nor left. Recalling that he had shortened
the time Zip was to wait, he broke into
a lope. His build made him the fleetest
runner in camp, and it did not take him long
to reach the stream. He had crossed it so
many times that the lower portion was
familiar, and he turned as if to follow it to
its source in the spring near Uncle Elk’s
cabin.</p>

<p>He found it of varying width. It was
so narrow where a regular path had been
made by the passing back and forth of the
hermit and his friends, that nothing in the
nature of a bridge was used. A long step
or a moderate jump served.</p>

<p>Nowhere did the depth seem to be more
than a few inches, except where a pool or
eddy occasionally appeared; but as Hoke
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
Butler picked his way along the bank, he
was pleased to note here and there a considerable
expansion.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” he said to himself; “it
will make it all the harder for that dog.”</p>

<p>He now put his scheme into operation.
Without removing his shoes, he stepped
into the brook, sinking halfway to his knees,
and began walking up the bed of the stream.
The water was as cold as ice, and he gasped
at first, but became quickly accustomed to
it. The bottom was so irregular that he
progressed slowly, and more than once
narrowly escaped falling. Here and there
boulders protruded from the shore and he
steadied himself by resting a hand upon
them as he labored past. Those that rose
from the bed of the stream itself and around
which the current foamed, afforded convenient
stepping stones and were turned to
such use.</p>

<p>“Of course that wouldn’t do on land,”
he reflected, “for the dog would catch the
scent, but he can’t know I’m in the water,
and will be hunting elsewhere for my trail.
He’ll be the most beautifully fooled dog in
Maine.”</p>

<h1  id='chXIX'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>CHAPTER XIX — The Final Test</h1>

<p>“Mr. George Burton may
think he has a mighty smart
dog,” reflected Hoke Butler,
as he picked his way up the small stream,
“and he isn’t any slouch, but there are some
things he can’t do, and one of them is to
follow a fellow’s trail through the water.
Funny that when Burton shut us off from
the lake he forgot this brook. Since he
didn’t mention it, I have the right to use it.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued the logical young man,
“while I keep to the water I don’t leave
any scent; I’m like the fawn which the
hound can’t track through the woods, and
when Zip comes to the point where I
stepped into the water, he’ll be up against
it—hello!”</p>

<p>He had come to a place where the brook
expanded into a pool and more than fifty
feet across. Opposite to where he halted,
the foaming current tumbled over a series
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
of boulders, and then spread out into the
calm expanse, whose outlet was the small
stream which Hoke had ascended to this
point. The water lost a good deal of its
limpidity, so that the bottom could be
traced only a little way from where he
stood.</p>

<p>“That’s bully!” exclaimed the Scout,
after brief reflection; “I’ll walk across the
pond—it can’t be deep—and step ashore on
the other side, Zip won’t come within a mile
of the spot.”</p>

<p>He began wading, cautiously feeling each
step before advancing. Since the depth
was unknown he could not be too careful,
though confident that the little lake was
shallow in every part.</p>

<p>Half across the icy water reached to his
knees. He pressed slowly on, thrusting out
a foot and making sure of a firm support.</p>

<p>“It ought now to grow more shallow,”
he reflected as he felt his way forward;
“when I get to shore I may as well go back
to the bungalow and wait till Zip returns
disgusted. I guess Burton can take a joke
when it’s on him, and he’ll laugh with the
rest of us——”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span></p>

<p>At that instant, Hoke stepped into an
unseen hole and dropped out of sight. The
sudden clasp of the icy element made him
gasp, and when his head popped up, he
spat and struck out frantically for land.
It was remarkable that the only spot in
the pond where the water was over his
head was barely two yards across, and
beyond it the depth was so slight that
while swimming, one of Hoke’s feet struck
bottom. He straightened up, and strode
to land, shivering in his dripping garments.</p>

<p>“Who’d have thought that? I didn’t
dream of anything of the kind—where did
<span class='it'>you</span> come from?”</p>

<p>This angry question was addressed to
Zip, who thrust his muzzle against Hoke’s
knee, looked up and wagged his tail.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what led you here, when
you hadn’t any scent to follow.”</p>

<p>“It was his nose,” remarked young Burton
some time later, when Hoke having
exchanged his wet clothing told his story
to the laughing group on the piazza.</p>

<p>“I left no scent when I stepped into the
brook,” replied Hoke.</p>

<p>“Therefore he knew you were in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
brook; and set out to find where you had
left it.”</p>

<p>“He had to follow both sides in turn.”</p>

<p>“Not at all; from one bank he could
detect, without the least difficulty, the
scent on the other side. He failed to take
it up, and therefore knew you had still kept
to the stream. If you had not been in
sight when he reached the pond, he would
have circled around it and nothing could
have prevented his discovering your trail
within the next few minutes. But he saw
you feeling your way across, and the direction
in which your face was turned told
him where you would come out,—so he
trotted around to welcome you when you
reached land.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he jump in to help me out
of the hole?”</p>

<p>“The bloodhound is content to leave that
kind of work to his brother the Newfoundland,
and a few others. You are ready to
admit, Hoke, that there are bigger fools
than Zip.”</p>

<p>“Yes,—and here sits one of them. Mike
doesn’t seem to care to match with him.”</p>

<p>“There’s where you’re mistook, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
Bridget Lanigan said whin she picked up a red
hot poker thinking it was a ribbon she had
dropped from her hair. Come, boys.”</p>

<p>Mike sprang from his seat and addressed
Alvin and Chester. There was much
chaffing as the three passed into the bungalow
and out at the rear. Zip had taken his
place beside his master’s chair, where he
sat with his long tongue hanging far out,
his mouth wide open, and his big ears dangling
below his massive jaws. He manifested
no further interest in what was
going on around him, though he must have
understood everything.</p>

<p>The agreement with Mike was that the
dog should remain on the piazza with his
master and the other scouts until a full
hour should have passed. Then he was to
be allowed to smell of a pair of shoes which
the fugitive left behind him. These belonged
to Alvin Landon, who had brought
some extra footgear. They had been worn
by Mike for several days when he replaced
them with his own, which he had on at the
time he left the bungalow. Thus far
everything was plain and above board.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what Mike has up his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
sleeve,” remarked young Burton; “no
doubt it is something ingenious, for he and
his two chums have been whispering and
chuckling a good deal together, but Zip will
defeat him as sure as the sun is shining in
the sky. You have noticed that my dog
does very little baying,—or rather, Isaac
and Hoke have noticed it.”</p>

<p>“But he gets there all the same,” laughed
Rothstein; “I should like to know what
plan Mike has in mind.”</p>

<p>“We shall learn when he comes back and
we hear his story.”</p>

<p>Prompt to the minute, Burton directed
the attention of Zip to the pair of shoes that
had been placed on the ground at the foot
of the steps.</p>

<p>“Find him,” was the command of his
master, and the hound fairly bounded out
of sight around the corner of the building.
He bayed once as he picked up the scent,
and then vanished like a bolt from a crossbow.
The crowd of Boy Scouts resumed
their chat and awaited as patiently as they
could the issue of the novel test.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mike Murphy and his two
chums set to work to carry out the scheme
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>243</a></span>
which they had formulated, and which each
one was confident must result in the humiliation
of the wonderful dog and his owner.
With abundance of time at their command
they did not hasten, but walked with a
moderate pace to a point some two hundred
yards from the bungalow. They had straggled
along side by side, without trying to
make their trail hard to follow, and now
halted.</p>

<p>“This is far enough,” remarked Alvin, as
the three peered around without seeing
any one.</p>

<p>His companions agreed. Then Alvin and
Mike sat down on the ground and exchanged
shoes. Not only that, but the former
stooped and the latter mounted his back,
his arms loosely around Alvin’s neck with
his legs projecting in front and supported
by the crooked elbows of his carrier. Then
he resumed his walk with Chester trailing
behind.</p>

<p>When the distance from the bungalow
had been doubled, Alvin asked:</p>

<p>“How much do you weigh, Mike?”</p>

<p>“A hundred and forty-three pounds—when
ye started.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it is about a ton now; how far
do you expect me to carry you?”</p>

<p>“Not far,—say two or three miles.”</p>

<p>“I rather guess not; Chest, it’s time you
took a turn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait awhile; you have only just
begun.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t as much fun as I thought,”
growled Alvin, resuming the task that was
fast becoming onerous.</p>

<p>“I’m enj’ying mesilf, as Jerry Dunn said
whin he tackled three p’licemen. When I
git tired I’ll sing out, and we’ll make a
change.”</p>

<p>Chester’s sense of justice led him soon
after to help in shifting Mike to his own
shoulders, and the progress was resumed
much the same as before.</p>

<p>You will perceive the trick the boys were
playing upon the bloodhound. Mike had
not only changed shoes with Alvin Landon,
but his new ones were not permitted to
touch ground while they traveled a fourth of
a mile through the unbroken woods. Moreover,
for this distance the leaves were
trampled by Mike’s shoes, but they were
on the feet of Alvin.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span></p>

<p>The next step in this curious mixup was
for Alvin, still wearing Mike’s shoes, to
diverge to the left, while Chester, with
Mike on his shoulders, went a considerable
distance to the right, where he halted and
the Irish youth slipped to the ground and
stood in the footgear of Alvin, who was so
far away that he could not be seen among
the trees.</p>

<p>All this was prearranged, as was that
which followed. Mike started off alone,
aiming to return to the bungalow by a long
roundabout course, while the other two
came together at a new point, and made
their way by a more direct route to where
their friends were awaiting them.</p>

<p>“I wonder that Zip doesn’t show up,”
said Alvin, when they caught sight of the
building, and he looked back; “it is considerably
past the hour, and he ought to
be in sight.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be he was sharp enough to
detect our track.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>And yet that is precisely what he did do,
and later, when all were gathered on the
piazza, including the dog, who arrived less
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
than ten minutes after the astounded Mike,
George Burton complacently explained how
it had all come about.</p>

<p>“It was an ingenious scheme, Mike, and
deserved success, but it did not bother Zip
for more than a few minutes. If a dog can
smile, he must have grinned when he penetrated
your strategy. You made one mistake
which was natural.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if our greatest mistake
was in thinking the pup didn’t know more
than ten times all of us together,” said
Mike with a sniff.</p>

<p>“That, too, was natural in the circumstances,
but when you changed your shoes
with Alvin, then was the time you three
should have parted company. Instead,
you stayed together, and Zip kept to the
trail, for it was the only one for him to
follow. Had you separated, he probably
would have followed Alvin for awhile, but
not long. He would have detected the
deception, run back to the point of separation
and hit the right one.”</p>

<p>“But he virtually did that afterward,”
remarked Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>“A proof of the truth of what I said.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
No doubt Zip trailed Alvin for a little way
or until he discovered that the scent had
changed and he was on the wrong track.
Then he turned back and hunted out the
right one.”</p>

<p>“If that explanation is correct,” said the
amazed Mr. Hall, “it proves that the bloodhound
was able to detect the emanations,
or whatever it was that exhaled from Alvin’s
feet, and could be differentiated from Mike’s
even though it must have passed through
the leather worn for days by Mike.”</p>

<p>“Unbelievable as it sounds we have to
admit it, but,” added Burton, “we mustn’t
lose sight of what doubtless was a contributing
factor. It was not Mike’s shoes alone
that told the secret, but his clothes. He
brushed the trees and limbs when carried
on the backs of his friends, and while walking.
It was that which was probably the
surest clue to Zip, as it was with Isaac and
Hoke, and made it impossible for any one
of the three to mislead the dog.”</p>

<h1  id='chXX'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>CHAPTER XX — Speed the Parting Guest</h1>

<p>George Burton and his dog Zip
had won golden opinions from the
Boy Scouts, who urged their visitor
to spend several days with them, but he
declined, saying he would set out on his
return to Mouse Island directly after dinner,
which was eaten at one o’clock. Truth
to tell his tastes differed from those of his
new friends. He cared little or nothing for
bird lore, or the study of trees, or roughing
it in the woods. But he was an athlete,
who could outrun any one of the Boy
Scouts and last longer on a tramp. He was
putting himself through a course of training,
with a view of making the football
team when he should enter Princeton University,
for which he had already matriculated.
His sole companion on his long runs
or the hours devoted to hardening his
muscles was Zip, between whom and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
himself, as had been shown, there was a strong
affection.</p>

<p>Accordingly, while the afternoon was
quite young, Burton shook hands with all
his friends, promising soon to see them
again, and stepped into one of the canoes
moored in front of the bungalow. He sat
on the bottom with Zip between his knees,
while Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes
manipulated the paddles. Mike Murphy
sat in front of Burton and assumed
the airs of a captain. Burton had intended
to pass around the eastern end of the lake,
and over the rough trace to the highway,
and so on to Boothbay and Mouse Island,
thus reversing this tramp of the day before.
Considerable of this long course could be
saved by using the boat.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can reach Mouse
Island before night,” remarked Alvin as he
slowly swung his paddle.</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Then why not stay with us and make
your start in the morning?”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference? The weather is
clear and cool, and the moon is near its
full. I can reach Boothbay Harbor some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
time in the evening and stay there over
night, and hire a launch to take me to
Mouse. Or if I feel lazy, I can find accommodations
at Bovil, which you know is a
little village between that frightful road
over which your supply team labors and
Boothbay. Zip and I don’t mind a little
thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Chester, “are we
never to be rid of those pests?”</p>

<p>On the shore of the lake to their right,
two men were seen standing with their
attention fixed upon the canoe and its occupants.
The distance was so slight that the
three boys instantly recognized them as
their old acquaintances,—Buzby Biggs and
Saxy Hutt. It would have been thought
that after their recent experience they
would have lost no time in getting out of
the neighborhood, but it will be remembered
that when they leaped in a panic from the
wagon of our old friend Jake, instead of
running away from Gosling Lake, they
headed toward it.</p>

<p>Zip was quick to identify the vagrants.
Looking toward them he emitted a throaty
growl.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span></p>

<p>“He hates tramps so, that I have to
restrain him when we meet them.”</p>

<p>“And why do ye reshtrain him?” asked
Mike from his place in the boat. “Why
don’t ye gratify his appetite for such spalpeens,
though I’m thinking he runs risk of
being p’isoned?”</p>

<p>“So long as the tramps keep out of mischief
I am willing to leave them alone.”</p>

<p>“But that is what they don’t do; they
seem to have a spite against Doctor Spellman
and his family.”</p>

<p>“Against Doctor Spellman!” exclaimed
Burton; “you don’t mean Doctor Wilson
Spellman?”</p>

<p>“That’s his name.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>Alvin lifted his paddle and pointed a
little away ahead and to the right.</p>

<p>“He has put up one of those patent houses
among the trees, where you can’t see it from
the lake, though we observe the smoke from
his fire now and then. There he and his
wife and little girl Ruth are spending several
weeks in the most sensible manner
possible.”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s my uncle,” added the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
surprised and delighted Burton; “I knew he
had gone on an outing in Maine, but thought
it was at the Rangely Lakes. Now, as the
expression goes, isn’t that ‘funny’?”</p>

<p>“You will like to call on him?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly; I’m very fond of him,
and of Aunt Susie and Ruth.”</p>

<p>The boat was sheered toward land at a
point where the canoe of the physician was
seen drawn up the bank. The two tramps
stood so motionless and fixed in their
attention that they suggested a couple of
scarecrows. Mike turned his head and
grinned.</p>

<p>“Head the boat toward them, as if ye
intinded to call and lave yer cards.”</p>

<p>The bow was whirled further around,
and pointed straight for the vagrants. Zip
was tremulous with eager expectation.
Resting his paws on the gunwales, he
twitched his ears and growled. One good
look at the canine was enough for the
men. They turned about and dived among
the trees as terrified as when the bullets of
Doctor Spellman’s revolver whistled about
their ears.</p>

<p>“Howld on!” shouted Mike, “till we can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
talk politics wid ye, and thry to agraa as
to whether the Bool Moose ought to be the
next President.”</p>

<p>But the scamps paid no heed, and Mike
looked commiserately at the dog.</p>

<p>“’Tis a cruelty thus to disappint ye,
Zip, as me dad said whin he walked five
miles to have a shindy with Terence Googhagan,
and found he’d been drowned; but
ye may git a chance at ’im later on.”</p>

<p>A few minutes afterward the nose of the
canoe slid up the bank, and the boys stepped
out. It being early in the afternoon, Doctor
Spellman was seated in his camp chair
in front of his house, smoking a cigar and
looking over the <span class='it'>Boston Globe</span>. His wife,
having set things to rights, had come forward
to join him, with Ruth directly behind
her.</p>

<p>The meeting was a pleasing one. When
Burton remarked that he had time for only
a call, the doctor and his family put so
emphatic a veto upon it, that he was
obliged to yield and agreed to remain until
morning.</p>

<p>After mutual inquiries and answers had
been made, Burton told of the forenoon’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
test of Zip’s marvelous power of scent.
The story was so remarkable that even
Sunbeam, as she sat on Burton’s knee,
silently listened. The two were old friends.
The little girl was the only one besides his
master whom the hound would allow to
become familiar with him.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a dog like him,” remarked
the doctor.</p>

<p>“That is impossible, for there isn’t
another like him,” replied the owner.</p>

<p>“I have been so annoyed by a couple of
tramps that I should like to get Zip on
their track and have him drive them out
of the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester had told the guest of
the doings of the nuisances, and there was
laughter at their panic when, looking over
the side of the canoe, they saw the frightful
head of the sea serpent, apparently in the
act of rising up to crush the boat or them in
its jaws.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand why they persist in
staying in these parts, after the hints they
have received,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Can they have any special design in
view?” asked Burton.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span></p>

<p>“I have thought of that, but can’t
imagine what it is. All such pests are
thieves, but that is the worst that can be
said of them. There is nothing in my
home that is specially tempting; they know
I have a gun and a revolver,—and that I
am quite ready to use it if they give good
cause. Yet when I kill a man,” added the
doctor with a grim smile, “I prefer to put
him out of the way in my professional
capacity. There are no unpleasant consequences
to myself.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t one of the spalpeens be ill?”
suggested Mike. “He may be trying to
screw up his courage to the p’int of asking
ye for a prescription.”</p>

<p>“He will find me ready, and I’ll charge
him no fee.”</p>

<p>At this moment, the physician supplemented
his words by a remark which, in
the light of after events, was singular to the
last degree.</p>

<p>“George, I have arranged a system of
signals with my young friends here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t catch your meaning.”</p>

<p>“When young Jack Crandall broke his
leg some time ago, there was no telling what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
complications would follow. It was therefore
agreed that in case I was needed in a
hurry, some of the Boy Scouts should fire
one of their revolvers several times in quick
succession. Then I would paddle to the
bungalow as fast as I could.”</p>

<p>“Could you count upon hearing the
reports?”</p>

<p>“Yes,—as a rule; there is nothing to
obstruct the sound on the water, unless it
might be a strong wind, and as to that we
shall have to take chances. My signal
may vary.”</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Your</span> signal,” repeated the astonished
nephew; “what need can you have for anything
of the kind?”</p>

<p>“Probably not any, and yet there’s no
certainty that I shall not. I brought some
fireworks for the amusement of Stubby.
Among them are a dozen sky rockets. If
we should find ourselves in need of help at
night, three rockets sent up in the sky will
notify the Boy Scouts, who I know will
make all haste hither, and a score of such
young fellows form a force that even a half
dozen men dare not despise. If I need
them after they have retired I can use my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
rifle or revolver the same as they would
use their weapon.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the emergency should happen
in the daytime?”</p>

<p>“We have our firearms to appeal to;
with them we can duplicate the call of the
Boy Scouts.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the system is the best that
can be devised,” said Burton, “and yet it
strikes me it is as likely to fail as to succeed.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“For your rockets to serve, some of the
boys must see them,—and what certainty
is there that they will do so?”</p>

<p>“Of course there’s the possibility that
they may not,—but until Scout Master
Hall and his charges retire for the night,
all or a majority of them are on the piazza
and some of them would be certain to
observe the rockets as they streamed
upward, leaving a trail of fire behind them.”</p>

<p>“But why talk of <span class='it'>your</span> needing <span class='it'>our</span>
help?” asked Alvin; “it strikes me as
absurd, though the reverse of the rule is
sensible.”</p>

<p>“I may as well confess that I feel uneasy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
over the persistent hovering of those tramps
in the neighborhood. I fear to leave wife
or Ruth alone, and I never do so even for
a short time without making sure my revolver
is loaded and at her instant command.”</p>

<p>“When you come to the bungalow, you
can bring Sunbeam and her mother with
you,” said Chester Haynes, “as you have
generally done.”</p>

<p>“That is my rule, but it leaves the house
without the slightest protection, and those
tramps, if they wish, can work their own
sweet will.”</p>

<p>“You did not visit us to-day, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Crandall is getting on so well there’s
no need; he moves about so readily on
those crutches you fellows presented him
that his rapid recovery is assured. If
to-morrow is fair, you may expect us over
to dinner.”</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester felt that this visit
really belonged to young Burton,—so, after
remaining a brief while longer, the three
bade them all good-bye and paddled back
to the bungalow, which they reached in the
latter part of the afternoon.</p>

<h1  id='chXXI'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>CHAPTER XXI — Call For Help</h1>

<p>On the evening of one Thursday in
August, Scout Master Hall and
the members of the three patrols
composing the troop of Boy Scouts were
lounging on the piazza of the bungalow or
clubhouse which stands on the shore of
Gosling Lake in Southern Maine. It was
the day succeeding the departure of George
Burton and his bloodhound Zip.</p>

<p>The hours had been busy ones for our
young friends. There had been fishing,
strolls through the woods, investigation of
the different kinds of trees, the study of
birds, besides a “deer hunt.” I hasten to
say that this was not a real hunt, a dummy
being used with bows and arrows as weapons.
This is one of the most popular forms
of amusements among Boy Scouts, who
enjoy it to the full.</p>

<p>So when the youths came back to headquarters,
they brought keen appetites,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
overflowing spirits and healthy tired bodies.
The gathering on the piazza was a pleasing
reunion of all the members. There were
experiences to be told, good natured chaffing,
the laying of plans for the morrow, and now
and then Mike Murphy, in answer to the
unanimous demand, sang for them. As I
have already said, this remarkable youth,
despite his unrestrainable waggery, would
never sing anything of a frivolous or “rag
time” nature, but inclined to sentimental
or religious themes. When that marvelous
voice of his, like the notes of a Stradivarius
violin in the hands of Ole Bull, or Spohr, or
Kubelik, was wafted across the placid lake,
it was easy to believe the story of the sirens
of Lorelei.</p>

<p>Thus the party was grouped on the night
I have named, and the hum and chatter of
conversation was at its height, when Scout
Master Hall exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Look!”</p>

<p>Every voice was instantly hushed. In
the gloom the leader’s arm which he had
instinctively extended could not be seen,
but naturally all who were not already looking
out upon the water did so. Every one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
was in time to see a swift ascending rocket
turn and break into a shower of sparks as
it dived downward again.</p>

<p>It was still in sight when a second whirred
upward for two hundred feet or more, leaving
a streaming, dazzling trail as it circled
over, exploded and the stick plunged downward
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Every one held his breath. Most of
them rose and stared. It might be that the
physician was sending up the rockets to
amuse his daughter. If there were only
two, they would mean nothing more; if
there was another——</p>

<p>“There it is!” gasped Scout Master Hall;
“something is wrong at Doctor Spellman’s!”</p>

<p>It was the signal which had been agreed
upon in the event of their friend finding
himself in urgent need of help.</p>

<p>It seemed as if several minutes passed
before, through the tomb-like hush, stole a
faint popping sound,—the report of the
explosion ending its journey across the lake.</p>

<p>The dull, almost inaudible call acted as
if it were a bugle blast. The whole party
dashed off the porch and at headlong speed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
to the two canoes drawn upon the beach.
Even Jack Crandall swung to the steps,
and debated a moment whether he should
not join the party of rescue, but his common
sense told him he would be only a
hindrance, and he reluctantly stayed behind
and watched the shadowy forms of his
friends as shown in the star gleam, the
moon not yet having risen.</p>

<p>“He has called for us,” said Scout Master
Hall, “and there isn’t a minute to lose!”</p>

<p>Standing on the edge of the lake he gave
his commands as coolly as an officer marshaling
his forces for a charge. In a twinkling
the two boats were afloat in the deep
water which came close to the bank.</p>

<p>“There are twenty-one of us; each
canoe will carry no more than eight; the
other five must hurry along the shore to
the doctor’s house.”</p>

<p>The lads stood breathless, waiting for the
leader to name those who must walk. He
promptly did so:</p>

<p>“Isaac Rothstein, Hoke Butler, Gerald
Hume, Arthur Mitchell, Gordon Calhoun.”</p>

<p>It was a keen disappointment to the five,
but there was not a murmur.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” called Hoke; “if we
do our best we shall not be far behind
them.”</p>

<p>His long legs carried him at a pace that
made it hard for the others to equal. In
Indian file the procession, with him in the
lead, loped along the beach and was speedily
swallowed up in the obscurity.</p>

<p>The crews of the canoes worked like
beavers. In a twinkling the boys had
adjusted themselves and in each boat the
two who were handiest with the paddles
plyed them vigorously. Scout Master
Hall was seated in the stern of one, among
his companions being Mike Murphy, Alvin
Landon and Chester Haynes.</p>

<p>At the moment the two craft put out from
shore, Mike Murphy repeated the exclamation—</p>

<p>“Look!”</p>

<p>The startling performance of a few minutes
before was repeated. One, two, three
rockets streamed upward in the heavens,
curved over, exploded and plunged downward
among the trees.</p>

<p>“What can be the trouble?” was the
question which everyone of the rescuers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
asked himself, as the oarsmen threw their
energies into the task, and sent the heavily-laden
craft with the utmost speed across
the lake toward the home of their friend.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester swung the paddles in
their canoe, which speedily assumed a
slight lead. There was little or no conversation,
but each Boy Scout was busy with
his thoughts, and burning with curiosity to
learn the cause of the strange night call
across the lake. Since every one knew of
the doings of the two tramps, who had been
lurking in the vicinity for several days and
had been seen the previous afternoon, it
was natural that suspicion should turn to
them.</p>

<p>And yet it was hard to imagine a situation
in which so plucky a man as Doctor
Spellman, who owned a revolver and a
repeating rifle, would have any fear of two
unarmed vagrants. Impulsive by nature,
and already resentful toward them, he would
stand no nonsense at their hands.</p>

<p>And for a third time were three signal
rockets sent streaming aloft, before the
canoes had passed half the distance between
the bungalow and the home of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
physician. The urgency of the summons filled
all with anguish. Mike and the Patrol
Leader offered to relieve Alvin and Chester
with the paddles, but they would not listen
and bent resolutely to their task. The
other canoe had pulled up alongside, and
the two kept abreast with barely ten feet
separating them.</p>

<p>The cause of the call of distress was
revealed with startling suddenness and
before the craft reached land. Through the
gloom, Mike Murphy caught the vague
outlines of a man and woman on the beach,
and he shouted:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, docther?”</p>

<p>The reply of itself was a partial answer:</p>

<p>“Is Ruth at the bungalow?”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t been there since ye brought
her over the other day.”</p>

<p>“Then heaven save us! she is lost.”</p>

<p>It was the mother who uttered this wail,
as she convulsively clasped her hands and
walked distractedly to and fro.</p>

<p>The boys leaped out of the boats and
gathered round the grief-smitten couple.</p>

<p>“Tell us what this means,” said Scout
Master Hall, as he sympathetically clasped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
the hand of the physician, who spoke with
rare self-command, though his wife began
sobbing as if her heart was broken:</p>

<p>“We did not miss her until about an
hour ago; I sat in front of the house smoking
and talking with wife, when she remarked
that it was time Ruth was in bed. I called
to her, but there was no answer. Thinking
she had fallen asleep inside, I lighted a
match and looked around, wife joining me.
A brief search showed she was not there.
We hurried outside, and I shouted again.</p>

<p>“By that time we were in an agony of
distress and wife was sure something dreadful
had happened to her. As soon as we
could command our wits we found that
neither of us had seen her for nearly two
hours and the thought struck us both that
she had wandered off to the bungalow. If
she had kept along the beach and walked
steadily she would have had time to reach
you, but there are so many other awful
chances that I dared not trust to that, so
I appealed to you.”</p>

<p>“And you did right; there is nothing that
is possible for us to do that we will not
do,” was the response of Scout Master Hall.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span></p>

<p>“She may still be wandering along the
beach on her way to the bungalow.”</p>

<p>“Five of our boys are hurrying over the
same course to this point, and will be sure
to meet and bring her home.”</p>

<p>“Unless she has strayed off in the woods
and been lost.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that such is the fact, for
then she will be safe and suffer only slight
inconveniences.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is worse than that,” moaned the
mother, still pacing to and fro and wringing
her hands; “she has fallen into the lake
and been drowned.”</p>

<p>“I cannot believe that,” said the Scout
Master, following the remark with such
tactful assurances that the mother regained
a part of her self-command, to the extent
even of feeling a faint hope that all was
well with her child.</p>

<p>The conduct of the youths was admirable.
When they spoke it was in whispers
and undertones, but every heart was filled
with the sincerest pity, and all were eager
to do everything they could for the smitten
parents.</p>

<p>The Boy Scout does not content himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
with words: his mission is to do a good turn,
and where every minute was beyond value
none was thrown away.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall assumed charge. He
directed six of the boys to take the back
trail, as it might be called,—that is, around
the eastern end of the lake to the bungalow.
This would insure their meeting Hoke Butler
and his companions, who in turn would
meet the missing child if she had wandered
over the same route. The six to whom this
task was entrusted were under the charge
of Mike Murphy.</p>

<p>The same number of boys were ordered
to follow the opposite direction,—that is,
to skirt the lake to the westward,—each
of the two searching parties to keep it up
until they came together at the bungalow.
This arrangement left four Boy Scouts,
including Mr. Hall and not mentioning the
father and mother. The leader proposed
that he, one of the lads and the parents
should separate, plunge into the woods and
pursue the hunt independently of one
another. Since for a time the search must
be a blind one this plan was as good as any
that could be suggested.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span></p>

<p>The Scout Master took Alvin and Chester
aside.</p>

<p>“I have selected you for a special work,”
he said. “You are fleet of foot, cool-headed
and have good judgment. The
doctor has made no reference to those
tramps, and yet I know he suspects they
have stolen Ruth, and intend to hold her
for ransom. I believe it is either that, or
she has wandered off and fallen asleep in
the woods,—with the possibility that she
is drowned.</p>

<p>“I want you to make your way as quickly
as you can to the little town of Bovil,
where I think there is a telephone. If the
tramps have kidnapped the Sunbeam, they
will try to get out of the neighborhood.
Telephone to the officers at Boothbay Harbor
and other points, and get word to Burton
at Mouse Island as soon as possible,
and ask him to make all haste here with
Zip. He’ll do it.”</p>

<h1  id='chXXII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>CHAPTER XXII — Groping In the Dark</h1>

<p>Five distinct parties were engaged in
searching for the missing child, Ruth
Spellman. Hoke Butler and his
companions had left the bungalow on foot,
because there was not room in the two
canoes for them. Knowing nothing of the
cause of the doctor’s appeal for help, they
made no hunt until, when the greater part
of the distance was passed, they met Mike
Murphy and his friends. These had
advanced at a slower pace, for they were
hunting for that which they dreaded to find,
and they meant to neglect nothing.</p>

<p>When the two parties came together, a
brief explanation made everything clear.
Inasmuch as the larger part of the beach
to the eastward had not been examined, it
was agreed that the coalesced companies
should return at a slower pace to the bungalow,
and then, if nothing resulted, reverse
and push the search all the way to the house
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
of Doctor Spellman. This would be covering
the ground twice, and it would be done
effectively.</p>

<p>“Do you think she has been drowned?”
asked Hoke of Mike.</p>

<p>“I do not, for it’s unraisinable that she
should be. The Sunbeam is afeard of the
water and would not step into it. If there
was a dock or a pile of rocks where she
could have fell off, she might have done the
same, but there’s nothing of the kind, and
the little one couldn’t have slipped into the
lake while walking along the shore.”</p>

<p>It may be said that this theory was
accepted by every one except the parents
and they were inclined toward it. It was
their anguish of anxiety which warped their
reasoning and made them fear at times that
that precious form was drifting in the
embrace of the chilling waters, and would
never again respond to their loving caresses.</p>

<p>While scrutinizing every foot of the way,
each member of the two parties scanned
the moonlit lake, as far as the vision
extended, urged by a fearful fascination
that scattered cold reasoning to the winds.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hoke Butler, who was slightly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
in the lead, stopped short, pointed out on
the water and asked in a startled undertone:</p>

<p>“Isn’t something floating out there?”</p>

<p>All grouped about the speaker and peered
in the direction he indicated.</p>

<p>“Ye’re right,” whispered Mike, swallowing
the lump in his throat; “can it be
Sunbeam?”</p>

<p>The surface of the lake was as placid as
a millpond. Barely a hundred feet from
shore a motionless object was seen floating,
but it was so low that for a time it could
not be identified.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking,” added Mike, “that she
would not float for a day or two, but bide
ye here till I swim out and make sartin.”</p>

<p>He began hastily disrobing, but before
he was ready for the plunge Hoke exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It’s the branch of a tree.”</p>

<p>Now that the assertion was made, all
saw that it was true. The identity of a
limb with its foliage was so evident that
they wondered how even a momentary mistake
had occurred. The advance was
resumed, and in the course of the following
hour the boys reached the bungalow, where
Jack Crandall was seated on the piazza
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
with his crutch leaning beside him. It
need not be said that he was shocked
beyond expression by the news.</p>

<p>“How I wish I were able to join in the
search,” he lamented, “but I can only sit
here and wait and pray for you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it likely she has been
drowned?” Hoke asked.</p>

<p>“No; and yet it is possible. She may
have slipped while walking on the edge and
a child like her is so helpless that it would
be all over in a minute or so. Keep up
your hunt until she is found and don’t
forget to scan every part of the lake you
can see.”</p>

<p>Jack made no reference to Biggs and
Hutt, the tramps, for he knew very little
about them. Mike, like his intimate
friends, had them continually in mind, but
the same strange dread that for a time
restrained them, held his lips mute. He
did not want to believe they had had any
hand in Sunbeam’s disappearance, and yet
the conviction was growing upon him that
they had kidnapped and would hold her
for ransom.</p>

<p>“And if the same proves true,” he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
muttered with the old glint in his eye, “it’s
mesilf and the rest of the byes that will do
the biggest kind of a good turn consarning
the spalpeens.”</p>

<p>For the second time the beach leading
from the bungalow eastward to the temporary
home of Doctor Spellman was traversed,
and the search if possible was made
more rigid than before. With so many at
work, a number tramped through the woods
bordering on the open space, though that
seemed useless since in the gloom their eyes
were of little help. They did not forget to
call the name of the lost one, Mike taking
upon himself this duty. He used her right
name as well as those by which he and other
friends knew her, and his clear voice penetrated
so far into the still arches that it was
heard by other searchers who, though they
shouted as loud, were not audible to him
and his companions.</p>

<p>Gradually they approached the desolate
home, arriving there about midnight. They
had not come upon the slightest clue and
no one was found in the house, nor was any
light burning. All were pretty tired, for
the tramp was a long one, but they were as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
ardent as ever to do their utmost to find
the missing child.</p>

<p>“There’s no use in going back to the
bungalow,” said Mike, as the group gathered
in the little clearing; “it strikes me
we may as well turn into the woods.”</p>

<p>It must have been about this time that
the searching party which had gone to the
westward completed the circumvallation
and joined Jack Crandall seated on the
piazza,—listening, watching and praying
that all might be well with the lost child.
These boys had been as painstaking and
thorough as Mike and his friends, and were
equally unsuccessful. Not the faintest
light upon the mystery had come to them.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it possible she took that
direction, unless it may have been for a
short distance, for there was nothing to
attract her thither. In visiting us she was
always brought across the lake, though I
heard her father say they had followed the
beach once or twice. The distance is less.”</p>

<p>“We fellows can’t go to bed,” said Colgate
Craig, “until the little one is found.”</p>

<p>“You have had a long tramp and must
be pretty tired.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span></p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with it,” said
Robert Snow sturdily; “we’ll keep it up
all night, if there’s the least chance of it
doing any good.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” said Jack, who had
learned the particulars of what had been
done from Mike Murphy, “Mr. Hall has
made no plans beyond what all of you were
to do first. You with Mike’s party have
gone round the lake, and a part of the distance—the
most promising as it seems to
me—has been covered twice.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is any use of our
retracing our steps?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest; wherever Ruth may
be found, it will not be in that direction.”</p>

<p>“Where do you advise us to go?”</p>

<p>“Follow Mike’s party; that will be the
third time the ground has been traversed.”</p>

<p>“What do you think has become of Sunbeam,
as Mike calls her?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me she has strayed only a
little way from home, grown weary, sat
down to rest and fallen asleep.”</p>

<p>The counsel of Jack Crandall was followed.
Thus the major part of the searchers
were soon pushing through the woods
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
in the neighborhood of Doctor Spellman’s
home. It will be recalled that he, his wife
and Scout Master Hall, set about this task
upon the first breaking up of the Boy
Scouts to prosecute their separate lines of
work. Although they parted company
directly after leaving the others, the three
kept in touch with one another, and after
a time husband and wife joined, with Mr.
Hall just far enough away to be invisible.</p>

<p>The Scout Master left it to the parents
of Ruth to call to her. They did this at
brief intervals, and they did not listen more
intently for the reply which came not than
did he. When an hour had been used without
result, the three came together in a
small open space lighted by the moon.</p>

<p>The mother, although distressed beyond
description, was become more composed.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Mr. Hall?” she
wearily asked.</p>

<p>“I judge that, like all healthy children,
Ruth is a sound sleeper. What more likely
than that when worn out, she has lain down
on the leaves like another Babe in the
Wood, and will not open her eyes until
morning? Am I not right, Doctor?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span></p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, provided she has been
permitted to do as you say.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you.”</p>

<p>“What is the use of our keeping silent,
when the same fear is in all our hearts?”</p>

<p>“I still fail to catch your meaning.”</p>

<p>“Wife, and you, and I believe she has
been kidnapped by those tramps.”</p>

<p>The mother gave a gasp and low moan.
Covering her face with her hands, she
sobbed:</p>

<p>“That’s what I have feared from the first.”</p>

<p>“I cannot deny that the dread has been
with me,” said the Scout Master, “yet I
have hoped and still hope we are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I see no room for such hope.”</p>

<p>“But, even if so, it should be an immeasurable
relief. It means that she has not
fallen into the lake, nor is she in danger
from a night’s exposure.”</p>

<p>“But think of her being in the power of
those hideous creatures,” wailed the mother.</p>

<p>“If they have stolen her it is for the purpose
of ransom. They will take the utmost
care that not the slightest harm befalls her,
since it would defeat their scheme.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span></p>

<p>“And this is the twentieth century!” was
the bitter exclamation of the physician.
“If the probability occurred to you and me,
why did we not take steps to baffle them
instead of wasting our time in groping
through the darkness of the woods?”</p>

<p>“I did do so.”</p>

<p>“Now it is I who do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Two of the fleetest of the Boy Scouts,—Alvin
Landon and Chester Haynes,—are
at this moment making all haste to the
village of Bovil, on the road to Boothbay
Harbor. If they can reach a telephone, they
will communicate with officers in the surrounding
towns and villages, asking for the
arrest of the tramps on sight. Those boys
will not waste a minute.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven for that.”</p>

<p>“Furthermore, at the earliest moment
they will ’phone your nephew, and you need
not be told that he and his dog Zip will be
equally quick in getting on the job.”</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>That</span> gives me more hope than anything
that has happened since my child disappeared,”
was the declaration of Doctor
Spellman, whose wife shared in the pleasurable
thrill.</p>

<h1  id='chXXIII'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>CHAPTER XXIII — A Fortunate Meeting</h1>

<p>Scout Master Hall was right
when he said Alvin Landon and
Chester Haynes would not waste a
minute in carrying out the task he had
given them. They were determined to
secure the arrest of the men who it was
believed had kidnapped the little daughter
of Doctor Spellman, before they could
leave that section. In addition, they
aimed to get the help of George Burton and
his bloodhound.</p>

<p>This last was far more important than
the other, and would insure the discovery
of the fate of the child. If Zip was allowed
to take the scent within twenty-four hours
after she left home—and possibly a little
later—he would never lose it.</p>

<p>It was four miles over the rough broken
trace to the highway, and then two more of
smoother traveling would bring them to the
straggling town of Bovil, where they hoped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
to secure telephonic communication with
Boothbay Harbor and other near by towns.
If that could be done, they could reach
Samoset Hotel, on Mouse Island, by the
same means. It would be like young Burton
to start at once. He could be taken
quickly across to Boothbay in a motor-boat,
where he knew the right course to
follow, since he had been over it with Zip.
He would have to ascend the Sheepscot
and walk three miles to reach Bovil, but if
a midnight start was made, he ought to
reach the village at daylight and soon after.</p>

<p>It was between eleven and twelve o’clock
that Alvin and Chester came in sight of the
score of buildings which make up the
village of Bovil. When they passed through
it on their way to Gosling Lake, they paid
so slight attention that they could not recall
whether it had an inn. Vastly to their
delight, however, they came upon the old-fashioned
structure near the center of the
place, and it was the only one in which a
light was burning.</p>

<p>“That’s luck,” said Alvin, as the two
ascended the steps, pushed open the door
and entered the roomy office, with its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
unpainted desk, broad fireplace where no
wood was burning, a bench without any
back, several rickety chairs, and showy
posters on the walls for the information of
travelers by boat or rail.</p>

<p>Staring around the room, by the dim
light of the kerosene lamp suspended from
the middle of the ceiling, the youths at first
saw no person, but heavy breathing directed
attention to a settee at the other side, upon
which a young man was stretched at full
length, with his coat doubled under him for
a pillow. He was the model watchman,
who was aroused only by vigorous shaking.
By and by he glumly assumed a sitting
posture, and blinked at the disturbers.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he demanded
sourly.</p>

<p>“Can you get us a room?”</p>

<p>“’Spose so. Why didn’t you come
earlier?”</p>

<p>“Because we came later,” replied Chester;
“have you got a telephone in the
house?”</p>

<p>“’Course we have,—what of it?”</p>

<p>“We want to use it at once to call up
Boothbay Harbor.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span></p>

<p>“This ain’t no time to bother with such
things; you’ll have to wait till morning.
What bus’ness had you to wake me up?”</p>

<p>“See here,” said Alvin, who was in no
mood for trifling, “we have come a good
many miles to reach a telephone; this is a
case of life and death; we haven’t a minute
to spare.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make no difference; you’ll have
to wait till to-morrer morning.”</p>

<p>“Give me the number of the Chief of
police at Boothbay.”</p>

<p>As Alvin made the peremptory request,
he slipped two silver half dollars into the
bony hand of the young man. This effected
the purpose intended. He became wide
awake on the instant, stepped briskly to
the desk, caught up the receiver of the
instrument, asked and answered several
questions, and after a brief wait, nodded to
Alvin, who with Chester stood at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he said, passing the
receiver to the former; “Art Spofford is the
chief of police at Boothbay, and he’s at
t’other end of the wire.”</p>

<p>Artemus Spofford, or “Art” as he is
called by every one, was courteous, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
replied that no tramps had been seen in
town for several weeks, but he and his officers
would be on the alert and arrest and
hold any vagrants answering the description.
Not only that, but he volunteered
to communicate with the neighboring towns
and see that every possible precaution was
taken.</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” he added; “don’t mix
in; I can attend to it better than you;
how shall I reach you, if we scoop in the
gentlemen?”</p>

<p>It was agreed that Art should ’phone to
Bovil, where some of the Boy Scouts would
call at intervals of a few hours to get any
message left for them. This arrangement
was the most convenient for all concerned.</p>

<p>It took some trying minutes for Alvin to
get Hotel Samoset on Mouse Island. It
looked as if Everett Ham, the night clerk,
was also asleep at his post, but I must not
do the faithful young man that injustice.
He responded after a time, and an understanding
was speedily reached.</p>

<p>“Is George Burton staying at your hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he has been here for a week.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span></p>

<p>“Please call him to the ’phone as quickly
as you can; this is of the utmost importance;
don’t delay for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Hold the wire.”</p>

<p>With his ear to the receiver, Alvin Landon
plainly heard by means of the marvelous
invention the hurrying footfalls of Clerk
Ham as he dashed out of the office, along the
hall and upstairs to rouse Burton. Sooner
than was expected he was back at the instrument.</p>

<p>“Hello! are you there?” he called.</p>

<p>“Yes; where is Burton?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t in the hotel.”</p>

<p>The boys were dumfounded for the
moment.</p>

<p>“You are sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve been to his room; he isn’t
there; then I remembered he went off two
days ago and hasn’t been back since.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he leave any word as to where
he was going?”</p>

<p>“He never does; he and that dog of his
are on the tramp all the time.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t help me to locate
him?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could; there’s only two things
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
he’s fond of,—that is scouting through the
country with that dog of his, and going to
clambakes. Capt. Free McKown says he’s
looney on clambakes and eats as much as
any two men.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Ham, will you be good enough
to give a message to Burton the first minute
you see him?”</p>

<p>“I surely will.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to make all haste to his uncle
on Gosling Lake—Got that? That their
little girl is lost, and her parents are distracted
with grief—Get that? And they
beg him to come as quickly as he can—Get
that?”</p>

<p>Ham repeated the substance of the words,
and then rang off.</p>

<p>“We may as well go to bed,” said Chester
to the clerk, who had sauntered back to
the settee and sat down. He lighted a
tallow candle and led them upstairs to a
roomy apartment, where he bade them good
night, pausing at the door long enough to
say:</p>

<p>“There’s only one other chap staying
with us; he’s at t’other end of the hall. Do
you want me to call you in the morning?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span></p>

<p>“No; we shall wake early.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bad setback,” said Chester
dejectedly, as the two began preparing for
bed; “we never dreamed that Burton
would be away from Mouse Island.”</p>

<p>“And with not the remotest idea of where
to look for him. He left his uncle’s house
this forenoon, and may be miles inland,
without our being able to get track of him
for a week. I can’t help feeling that Zip
is the only one that can solve the puzzle,
and it won’t take him long to do so.”</p>

<p>“No one who knows the dog can doubt
that. If Sunbeam has managed to fall
into the lake, he will lead us to the spot.
If those scamps have stolen her, she will be
found within an hour or two,—and then
may the Lord have mercy on them!”</p>

<p>“Chest, do you believe they are mixed
up in this business?”</p>

<p>“I can’t help suspecting it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, even though their hanging
about Doctor Spellman’s home has a bad
look. Those kidnappings are done in the
cities,—not in the open country like this;
and then think for a moment of the conditions.
For two tousled bums to steal a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
little girl, and compel her father to pay a
ransom for her,—here in the Maine woods,
within a few miles of Boothbay Harbor,—why
the thing is preposterous.”</p>

<p>“Has it occurred to you that they may
be connected with others? They may be
agents of the Mafia or Camorra or some
regularly organized gang of kidnappers.”</p>

<p>This was new to Alvin, and disturbed him
painfully. What was improbable about
it? The persistency of Biggs and Hutt in
prowling about the lake suggested a strong
motive,—such as that of earning a big reward
through the commission of some such
crime as indicated.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Chest, none of us has gone
the right way about this business. Suppose
Chief Spofford or some other officer
succeeds in arresting the two tramps, what
good will it do? They are not such fools
as to walk into a town with a little girl in
their charge. They would be called to
account on sight without any request from
her friends. As we agreed, we must pin
our faith on the bloodhound, and we may
not find him for days, when the trail will
be so cold that even he cannot follow it.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span></p>

<p>The two felt that for the present they
were at the end of their rope. They had
done all they could to set the wheels in
motion for the arrest of the tramps who
were under suspicion, and the dread was
strong with them that if such arrest could
be brought about it would affect nothing.
Any plan for the kidnapping of the little
girl would be so cunningly laid by master
minds that their agents would never walk
into a trap, no matter how skilfully set.</p>

<p>“We must find Burton and his dog,” was
the last remark of Alvin. His companion
murmured assent and then the two sank
into the sleep of weariness and sound
health, because of which they did not awake
until the young man who had received
them the night before hammered on the
door and shouted that breakfast would be
ready in ten minutes.</p>

<p>With self-reproaches they bounded out
of bed, hurried through their preparations,
and went down stairs two steps at a time.
The meal was on the table, and for the
moment they were the only guests, with the
young man referred to acting as waiter.</p>

<p>The boys had hardly seated themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
when through the open door entered a third
guest, accompanied by a black, sturdy, long-eared
dog, and the name of the youth was
George Burton and that of his canine companion
Zip.</p>

<h1  id='chXXIV'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>CHAPTER XXIV — “The Latchstring Was Inside!”</h1>

<p>The meeting was a joyous one. Alvin
and Chester sprang to their feet
and grasped in turn the hand of their
astonished friend, while Zip, never forgetting
his dignity, looked on as if he understood
it all, as quite likely he did.</p>

<p>“I didn’t leave Uncle Wilson’s until after
dinner yesterday,” said Burton, “and as
Zip and I were in no hurry, it was growing
dark when we got here. Somehow or
other, I fancied the looks of this old-fashioned
inn and decided to stay over
night, but what is it brings you here?”
asked the young man as all three sat down
to the table.</p>

<p>And then Alvin told his astounding story,
to which Burton listened with breathless
interest.</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” he exclaimed; “it distresses
me more than I can tell. It was
fortunate indeed that I decided to stop
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
here, for I may not return to Mouse Island
for several days. I reckon we shall do some
tall traveling to Gosling Lake.”</p>

<p>They did not linger over their breakfast.
Burton tossed a few mouthfuls of meat to
the dog, which sat on the floor beside his
chair. As a rule, when off on one of his
tramps, the hound shared his room, though
he did not do so at the bungalow, which
explained why Alvin and Chester saw
nothing of the animal when they arrived
several hours before.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any use to theorize,” remarked
Burton, as the three paid their bill and
hurried out of the inn, “for at such times
you are more likely to be wrong than right.
Ruth may have fallen into the lake and been
drowned, without her body being found
for several days; it may be that those
tramps belong to an organized gang and
have stolen and hidden her, but in that
case,” added the young man with a flash
of his eyes, “they forgot to reckon with
Zip; and if so, they will soon learn their
mistake.”</p>

<p>“The general belief when we left last
night,” said Chester, “was that she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
simply wandered off in the woods until
tired out, when she lay down and fell
asleep.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable, but I can’t
shake off the fear that it is not the right
explanation.”</p>

<p>It need not be said that while the three
boys were hurrying over the highway and
along the rough path with the eager Zip,
who knew that something was in the air,
keeping them company, the Boy Scouts
and Doctor Spellman and his wife were
busy.</p>

<p>Their aimless groping through the wood
was kept up until far beyond midnight,
when the physician compelled his wife to
return with him to the house and lie down
for a brief rest. Scout Master Hall suggested
to the members of the troop to
return to the bungalow, he accompanying
them, where they too secured sleep, and
ate their morning meal at daylight. The
agreement was that all should assemble at
an early hour at the doctor’s home, where a
decision would be made as to what was
next to be done.</p>

<p>If the child, as all prayed was the case,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
had simply gone astray in the woods, she
would awake at an early hour and renew
her effort to find her way home. With so
many persons wandering here, there and
everywhere she must hear their calls and
her rescue could not be long delayed. If
such proved not to be the case, and she
had not been drowned, it would mean the
worst. She was the victim of the most
atrocious miscreants who lived,—for no
crime is more merciless and unforgivable
than the kidnapping of the pet of a household,
and giving its parents the choice of
paying an enormous ransom or never seeing
it again.</p>

<p>Now, it may have struck you as strange
that no reference has been made to Uncle
Elk in the consternation which followed the
discovery that Ruth Spellman had been
lost or stolen. In knowledge of woodcraft
none of the searchers could be compared
to him, and yet no one had asked his help.
The reason was simple. With all his skill
in the ways of the forest, he could do no
more, so long as the night lasted, than the
youngest member of the Boy Scouts. He
could join in the aimless groping and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
shouting, but with a score already doing their
utmost, he would simply be one among
them.</p>

<p>Although morning brought a change of
conditions, it would seem that they were
still unsurmountable, for what Apache, or
Sioux or Shawnee (unless he were Deerfoot)
could trail a little child through the
forest, when her almost imperceptible footprints
had been repeatedly crossed by other
feet?</p>

<p>“I think we ought to appeal to Uncle
Elk,” said Scout Master Hall to the parents,
after the scouts assembled at the Doctor’s
home had scattered to press their hunt
harder than ever. “None of us can equal
him.”</p>

<p>“You know that for some cause which I
cannot fathom, he has formed an intense
dislike for my wife and me,” said the perplexed
father.</p>

<p>“But it is impossible that it should
include the little one. At such a time as
this no heart has room for enmity, no matter
what fancy may have dictated.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to be guided by your judgement,”
replied the doctor, after his wife
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
had joined in the plea. “If Ruth has slept
alone in the woods, she must have awakened
an hour or two ago and ought to have been
found. I don’t see how the old hermit can
help us, but we must neglect nothing.
Come on.”</p>

<p>But Mike Murphy had anticipated their
action. We know what unbounded faith
he held in Uncle Elk, and more than once
he had felt inclined to go to his cabin.
With the coming of morning he decided to
do so.</p>

<p>Consulting with Patrol Leader Chase,
Mike found that he had formed the same
decision. Accordingly the two withdrew
from the others without attracting notice
and made their way together to the cabin
of their old friend. This was so far removed
from the zone of active search that none of
the other Scouts was met.</p>

<p>“If he can’t help us, no one can,” said
Chase.</p>

<p>“There’s only one cratur that can thrack
Sunbeam through the woods, and his name
is Zip,” replied Mike. “If I hadn’t seen with
me own eyes what he can do, I wouldn’t
belave the same. Wal, here we are!”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span></p>

<p>They had reached the little clearing in
the middle of which stood the familiar
cabin, as silent and devoid of all signs of
life as ever. Without hesitation, Mike led
the way up the path, placed his foot on
the small steps, and was about to reach up
to draw the latch, when he recoiled with a
gasp.</p>

<p>“Do ye obsarve that?” he asked in a
startled whisper.</p>

<p><span class='it'>The latchstring was inside!</span></p>

<p>Never since the leathern thong was first
shoved through the little orifice above the
tongue of iron had this occurred, by day or
night.</p>

<p>The two boys stood for several minutes
staring at the blank door, and then looked
in each other’s face. Not the slightest
sound was heard from within.</p>

<p>“What does it mean, Mike?” asked the
Patrol Leader in a still lower whisper.</p>

<p>“It maans ‘no admittince’; this is no
place for us. I can’t guess what raison
Uncle Elk has for shutting ivery one out,
but he’s done it, and we must respect it.”</p>

<p>They turned away, hurrying in the direction
of Doctor Spellman’s house, and had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
almost reached it when they met the physician,
his wife and Scout Master Hall, to
whom the two boys told the astounding
news. In other circumstances they would
have theorized as to the cause of Uncle
Elk’s unaccountable action, but there was
only one theme that filled every mind.</p>

<p>“It shuts us off from any aid by <span class='it'>him</span>,”
remarked the doctor; “we can only keep
up the search and wait for the coming of
my nephew and his dog,—but,” he added
bitterly, “that may not be for days, when
even he can do nothing.”</p>

<p>A ringing shout caused all to turn their
heads and look along the beach toward the
northern side of the lake. Three boys were
coming toward them on a run, and a few
paces ahead of them, as if he were their
leader, galloped a black dog.</p>

<p>“God be thanked!” exclaimed the mother
clasping her hands. “It’s George and Zip!”</p>

<p>“Not forgitting Alvin and Chest, the
two best boys that iver lived, barring only
mesilf.”</p>

<p>The next minute the parties were mingling,
and greeting one another. Alvin,
Chester and young Burton were panting,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
for they had not let the grass grow under
their feet on the way from Bovil to Gosling
Lake, but they were still good for much
more of the same kind of work.</p>

<p>“Zip is ready,” said his master, “and we
are near the house. Let’s make a start,
for we are soon to learn the truth.”</p>

<p>The news of the arrival of Zip quickly
spread by means of shouts and calls to the
scattered Boy Scouts, who began flocking
to the quarters of Doctor Spellman, until
very nearly the whole troop were gathered
there. In answer to the request of Burton
for some article of wearing apparel recently
worn by Ruth, the mother with a calmness
that impressed every one, brought forward
a pair of chubby shoes, which the little one
in an effort to “break them in” had kept
on her feet until late in the afternoon, when
they irked her so much she changed them
for an old pair. Burton held them out to
Zip, who sniffed several times and then
turned his head away to signify that he had
learned enough.</p>

<p>“Now, get to work!” commanded his
master.</p>

<p>The scent was perhaps fourteen hours old
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
when the Boy Scouts assembled in front of
the wooden structure, saw Zip begin trotting
to and fro with his nose to the ground.
Suddenly he bayed slightly, and started
down the slope in the direction of the lake.</p>

<p>“He’s hit the trail!” said the excited
Burton, dashing after him; “not too fast,
Zip.”</p>

<p>The youth never used a leash. The
hound wore a handsome collar with his
name and the address of his master engraved
on it. His voice was sufficient to restrain
Zip if he traveled too rapidly.</p>

<p>But the dog at his slowest traveled so
fast that the boys had to trot to keep pace
with him. His master by common consent
took the lead, with Alvin, Chester,
Mike and the others at his heels. Zip
would have drawn away from them all had
not his master sharply restrained him. The
doctor was well to the rear, in order to keep
company with his wife.</p>

<p>The hound went straight toward the
water, but a few paces away turned to the
left, taking a course which if continued
would lead him to the bungalow. This
was kept up for more than a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
yards, when he abruptly stopped and throwing
up his head looked off over the lake,
without emitting any sound.</p>

<p>The mother with a moan staggered and
would have fallen had she not been caught
in the arms of her husband.</p>

<p>“That means she is drowned!” faintly
whispered the stricken wife. “O Wilson!
I cannot bear it!”</p>

<p>“No, my dear; he has gone forward
again; be brave; hope is still left.”</p>

<p>Zip now led the company along the beach,
at the same steady trot, with his master
almost near enough to grasp his collar, and
checking him now and then when he went
too fast. There could be no doubt that he
was following the scent, from which nothing
could divert him.</p>

<p>But whither was it leading?</p>

<p>The run was a long one, always within a
few paces of the water, until a point was
reached opposite the path which led to the
cabin of Uncle Elk. Here, to the astonishment
of every one, the dog turned off and
went up the slope.</p>

<p>“What can that mean?” was the question
which each one asked himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span></p>

<p>And with more amazement than before,
the procession of pursuers saw Zip follow
the path across the clearing to the door of
the cabin, where he stopped, threw up his
nose and bayed. It was notice that he
had reached the end of the trail.</p>

<p>Ruth Spellman was inside the log structure.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the whole company was
grouped around the front of the building.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go in?” demanded the
Doctor, pressing impatiently forward.</p>

<p>“You forget the latchstring is inside,”
reminded Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>“What difference does that make? Is
this a time to hesitate? Let’s break in the
door! Make room for me and I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>Mike Murphy, Alvin Landon and Chester
Haynes ran to the little window a few
paces beyond the door and peered through
the panes.</p>

<p>“Sunbeam is there!” shouted Mike, “and
nothing is the matter with her!”</p>

<p>Before he could explain further, there was
a crash. The impact of Doctor Spellman’s
powerful shoulder carried the staple which
held the latch from its fastenings and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
door swung inward. Through it swarmed
the Boy Scouts, the physician and his wife
in the lead.</p>

<p>In front of the broad fireplace, where the
embers had long died, sat Uncle Elk in his
rocking chair, silent, motionless and with
head bowed. Seated on his knees, with
her curls half hiding her pretty face and
resting against his massive chest, was Ruth
Spellman, sleeping as sweetly as if on her
cot at home.</p>

<p>With a glad cry, the mother rushed forward
and flung her arms about the child,
sobbing with joy.</p>

<p>“O my darling! Thank heaven you are
found!” and she smothered the bewildered
one with kisses and caresses.</p>

<p>Suddenly Doctor Spellman raised his
hand and an instant hush fell upon all.
He had lifted the limp arm of the man and
placed his finger on the wrist. The professional
eye saw that which escaped the
others. He said in a solemn voice:</p>

<p>“Uncle Elk is dead!”</p>

<h1  id='chXXV'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>CHAPTER XXV — And the Last</h1>

<p>Enough has been said in the preceding
pages to show that Elkanah
Sisum was a man of excellent birth
and superior culture. He possessed moderate
wealth, and when admitted to the
bar his prospects could not have been
brighter, but misfortune seemed to have
marked him for its own. It delivered the
first crushing blow by taking away the
beloved wife of his young manhood, and
leaving him an only child,—Ruth, who was
as the apple of his eye. At eighteen she
married a worthy young man who was
admitted as a partner in the law firm and
displayed brilliant ability. Unto the couple
was born also a single daughter, named for
its mother.</p>

<p>Sisum never remarried, but lavished his
affection upon his daughter and especially
the grandchild Ruth, whom it may be said
he loved more than his own life. Thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
things stood until the little one was nearly
five years old, when she showed alarming
signs of sinking into a decline. Her
parents decided to take her on a long sea
voyage in the summer time. The understanding
was that they were to be gone for
several months, but they never returned.
Their steamer was not heard of again.</p>

<p>It was years before the grandfather gave
up hope. The long brooding over his grief
and the final yielding to despair,—slow but
final,—produced a strange effect upon his
mind. Only his most intimate friends saw
that his brain was affected; others met and
talked with him daily with never a suspicion
of the fact. He had come to the
gradual but fixed belief that although his
dear ones had left him for the land of
shadows, yet somewhere and at some time
in this life his grandchild would come to
him. She might not remain long, but she
would reveal herself unmistakably before
Uncle Elk himself passed into the Great
Beyond. It was the centering of his
thoughts and hopes upon this strange
fancy that was actual monomania. Scout
Master Hall detected it, though none of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
the Boy Scouts dreamed of anything of the
kind. As the delusion fastened itself upon
the old man, he formed a distaste for society,
which of itself grew until it made him
the hermit we found in the Maine woods
during this summer. There he spent his
hours in reading, and in studying animal
and bird life,—trees and woodcraft. He
never lost his gentle affection for his fellow
men, and at long intervals visited his former
acquaintances; but, though he left his
latchstring outside and gave welcome to
whoever called, he preferred to make his
abiding place far from the haunts of men.</p>

<p>What mind can understand its own mysteries?
While the current of life was moving
smoothly with the old man, Doctor
Spellman put up his summer home on the
shore of the lake not very distant from the
cabin of Uncle Elk. The latter set out to
call upon them almost as soon as he learned
of their arrival. While too far for the couple
to see him, he caught sight of them sitting
in front of their structure, the doctor smoking
and the wife engaged in crochet work.
Their child was playing with a doll indoors,
and Uncle Elk saw nothing of her, nor did
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
he learn of her existence until several days
later, when occurred the incident that will
be told further on.</p>

<p>It was that sight of the man and woman
that gave a curious twist to the delusion of
the hermit. He was startled by the
woman’s striking resemblance to his own
daughter who had been lost at sea years
before. He formed a sudden and intense
dislike of the man who had presumed to
marry a person that resembled his child,
and it was painful to look upon the wife
who bore such a resemblance. No brain,
except one already somewhat askew, could
have been the victim of so queer a process.
Such, however, was the fact and of itself it
explains a number of incidents that otherwise
could not be explained.</p>

<p>It will be noted that thus far Uncle Elk
had not seen the little child who was the
image of her mother, and since the parents
quickly learned of his strange antipathy
and took care to avoid meeting him, it is
unlikely that in the ordinary course of
events he ever would have come face to
face with the little one.</p>

<p>Now nothing is more evident than the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
absurdity of my trying to describe the
mental ordeal through which this man
passed on that last and most memorable
night of his life. I base what I say upon
that which Doctor Spellman told me as the
result of his painstaking investigation, during
the succeeding months, of the most
singular case with which he was ever concerned,
and even the brilliant medical man
could not be absolutely certain of all his
conclusions. However, they sound so reasonable
that I now give them.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon, Uncle Elk
was depressed in spirits, as is sometimes
true of a person who is on the eve of some
event or experience of decisive importance
to himself. He was subject to a peculiar
physical chilliness which led him to kindle
a fire on his broad hearth, in front of which
as the night shadows gathered, he seated
himself in his cushioned rocking chair.
As time passed he gave himself over to
meditation of the long ago with its sorrowful
memories.</p>

<p>He had sat thus for some time when he
was roused by the twitching of the latchstring.
He turned his head to welcome his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
caller, when he was so startled that at first
he could not believe what his eyes told him.
A little girl, of the age and appearance of
the one who had gone down in the depths
of the fathomless sea, stood before him.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” called the child in her
gentle voice; “how do you do?”</p>

<p>“Who are you? What’s your name?”
faltered the astounded old man.</p>

<p>“I am Ruth,” she replied, coming toward
him with the trusting confidence of childhood.</p>

<p>This was the name of the loved one who
had left him in the long ago. The resemblance
was perfect, as it seemed to him.
<span class='it'>It was she!</span></p>

<p>He rose to his feet, reached out, clasped
her hand and touched his lips to the chubby
cheek.</p>

<p>“God be praised! You are my own
Ruth come back to me after all these
years!”</p>

<p>That poor brain, racked by so many torturing
fancies, accepted it all as truth.</p>

<p>“I am so tired,” said the wearied little
one, “I want to rest myself.”</p>

<p>He tenderly lifted her in his arms and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
carried her behind the curtains, through
which the firelight shone, laid her on the
couch with her head resting on the pillow,
and drew the coverlet over her form. At
the end of the few moments thus occupied
he saw that she had sunk into the soft
dreamless sleep of health and exhaustion.</p>

<p>He came back to the sitting room. The
outer door stood ajar, as it had been left
by the infantile visitor. As he closed it
he did an unprecedented thing,—he drew in
the latchstring. He wanted no intruders
during these sacred hours. Then he seated
himself as before and gave himself up to
musings and to wrestling with the problem
which was really beyond his solution.</p>

<p>There must have been moments when he
glimpsed the truth. That which he had
lifted in his arms was flesh and blood and
therefore could not be the Ruth who had
stepped into the great unknown many
years before. Yet she looked the same,
and bore her name. Could it not be that
heaven had permitted this almost incomprehensible
thing?</p>

<p>He sat in front of the fire, which was
allowed to smoulder all through the night.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_311' id='Page_311'>311</a></span>
It is probable that he rose more than once,
drew the curtains aside and looked upon
the little one as revealed in the expiring
firelight.</p>

<p>“Whatever the explanation, it means
that <span class='it'>my</span> Ruth and I will soon be together.
If it is not she who has come to me, I shall
soon go to her.”</p>

<p>Unlocking a small drawer of the table,
he drew out a large, unsealed envelope,
unfolded the paper inside, glanced at the
writing, returned it to the enclosure and
laid it on the stand where it could not fail
to be seen by any visitor, and then resumed
his seat.</p>

<p>“By this time,” said Doctor Spellman,
“the brain which had been clouded probably
became normal. He knew that my Ruth
could not be his Ruth. He must have seen
that she was the child of the man whom he
intensely disliked because I had presumed
to marry a woman who resembled the
daughter whom he had lost.”</p>

<p>When daylight returned, Uncle Elk after
a time aroused himself. He did not renew
the blaze on the hearth, but once more
drew the curtain aside. Ruth Spellman
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_312' id='Page_312'>312</a></span>
still slept. As gently as he had laid her
down, he raised and carried her back to
his chair where he resumed his seat, with
the curly unconscious head resting upon his
breast, and after a time, he closed his own
eyes, never to open them again.</p>

<p>In the presence of death all was hushed.
The Boy Scouts bowed their uncovered
heads, and as they stood in the crowded
room gazed in awe upon the gray head and
inanimate form in the chair. Even the
overjoyed mother who had clasped her
loved child and lifted her from the lifeless
arms suppressed her glad croonings, while
the bewildered Ruth gazed upon the strange
scene with hardly a glimmering of what it
all meant.</p>

<p>For the moment, Doctor Spellman was
the professional expert. In a low voice he
addressed the Scout Master and the young
friends who looked into his face and listened.</p>

<p>“Uncle Elk passed away several hours
ago,—his death from heart failure was so
painless that it was like falling asleep, as
was the case with our child. This looks as
if he had left a message for us.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_313' id='Page_313'>313</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, the doctor picked up the
large unsealed envelope and held it up so
as to show the address,—“To be opened
by whosoever finds it after my death.”</p>

<p>Drawing out and unfolding the sheet, the
physician read aloud:</p>

<p>“It is my wish to be buried on the plot
between my cabin and the brook. Over my
grave a plain marble stone is to erected
with the inscription, ‘Elkanah Sisum. Born
January 23, 1828; died ——’ Add nothing
to the date of my death. Inclosed are
enough funds to pay the expense. Whatever
remains, which is all the money I
possess, I desire to be presented to the
Sailors’ Snug Harbor, New York.”</p>

<p>Having finished the reading, the physician
added:</p>

<p>“The coroner must be notified and the
proper legal steps taken. We should get
word to Boothbay Harbor as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>“I will attend to that,” said George
Burton, “and start at once.”</p>

<p>The wishes of Uncle Elk were carried out
in spirit and letter. The clergyman who
came from Boothbay Harbor preached a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
touching sermon, and a score of men who
had known the old man for years came out
to the cabin to pay their last respects. The
evidence of Doctor Spellman was all the
coroner required, and there was no hitch
in the solemn exercises.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy, when he could command
his emotions, sang “Lead, kindly
Light,” with such exquisite pathos that
there was not a dry eye among the listeners.
The grave had been dug by the Boy Scouts,
who stood with bared heads as the coffin
was slowly lowered into its final resting
place. A few days later all departed for
their homes, carrying memories of their
outing in the woods of Southern Maine,
which will remain with them through life.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
